# DNA Church Implementation Roadmap

**Complete Timeline & Resource Guide for Church Leaders**

*Last Updated: January 2026*

---

## Overview

This roadmap guides churches through the complete DNA discipleship implementation process, from initial assessment to launching multiplying DNA groups.

**DNA (Discipleship Naturally Activated)** is a 5-phase, 12-month multiplication system that transforms believers into confident disciple-makers.

**This roadmap is for:**
- Pastors implementing DNA for the first time
- Discipleship leaders launching DNA in their church
- Church leadership teams exploring multiplication discipleship

---

## Two Distinct Pathways

### **Pathway 1: FIRST-GENERATION Leaders** (Initial Church Launch)
These are your church's first DNA leaders who have never led a DNA group before.

**Timeline:** 6 months of preparation + 12 months of leading = 18 months total

---

### **Pathway 2: SECOND-GENERATION Leaders** (Emerging from Groups)
These are disciples who have completed a 12-month DNA cycle and are ready to multiply.

**Timeline:** 12 months of being discipled + multiplication readiness = 12-13 months total

---

# PATHWAY 1: First-Generation Leaders

## Complete Timeline Overview

**Total preparation time:** ~6 months (24 weeks)  
**Then:** 12 months leading their first DNA group  
**Total:** 18 months from start to multiplication

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **1. Rushing the Prep (Skipping Steps)**

**Mistake:** "Let's skip the Dam Assessment and just start leading groups."

**Why it fails:** Leaders multiply their unhealed wounds, control issues, and fears into disciples.

**Solution:** Trust the 6-month prep timeline. Every step matters.

---

### **2. Skipping the 8-Week Toolkit Experience**

**Mistake:** "We read the toolkit. We're ready to lead."

**Why it fails:** Reading ≠ Experiencing. Leaders feel unprepared, groups struggle, momentum dies.

**Solution:** ALWAYS have first-generation leaders experience the toolkit as a practice group.

---

### **3. Not Addressing Dams**

**Mistake:** "That assessment is too intense. Let's just do the readiness quiz."

**Why it fails:** Internal obstacles block multiplication. Leaders plateau or quit.

**Solution:** Make Dam Assessment mandatory. Debrief thoroughly. Address issues before launching.

---

### **4. Launching Without Co-Leaders**

**Mistake:** "I'll find a co-leader later. Let me just start."

**Why it fails:** Solo leaders burn out, lack accountability, and can't multiply effectively.

**Solution:** No co-leader = no launch. This is non-negotiable.

---

### **5. Not Multiplying**

**Mistake:** "We love our group. Let's just keep meeting."

**Why it fails:** Addition replaces multiplication. The DNA cycle breaks. Leaders become lake-focused.

**Solution:** Multiplication is non-optional. Set the date at the beginning. Celebrate sending, not just keeping.

---

### **6. Treating DNA Like a Program**

**Mistake:** "DNA is our new small group curriculum."

**Why it fails:** DNA is a culture shift, not a program. Programs can be added/dropped. Culture changes everything.

**Solution:** DNA must become "the way we do discipleship." It's not an option—it's THE pathway.

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### **Problem: Leaders are hesitant to commit 6 months of prep**

**Solution:** 
- Emphasize: Better to launch ready than to launch too soon
- Show the long-term ROI: 6 months prep → 5-10 years of multiplication
- Offer: Start with 1-2 pilot leaders instead of 4-6

---

### **Problem: Leaders score "Not Ready" on Readiness Quiz**

**Solution:**
- Celebrate honesty and self-awareness
- Create specific 6-8 week growth plan
- Offer co-leader role under experienced leader
- Reassess after growth period

---

### **Problem: 8-Week Toolkit feels redundant to leaders**

**Solution:**
- Reframe: "This isn't repetition—it's practice. You're learning to facilitate, not just participate."
- Emphasize: Watching ≠ Doing. You need to LEAD these tools, not just experience them.
- Show: The difference between knowing the tool and facilitating the tool

---

### **Problem: Disciples don't commit to multiplication**

**Solution:**
- Revisit expectations: Was multiplication clearly communicated from the start?
- Address fears: Use Lake to River Series to process multiplication fears
- Extend timeline: Give 3-6 more months if needed, but don't abandon multiplication

---

### **Problem: Co-leaders don't step up to lead**

**Solution:**
- Assess: Did they receive enough empowerment and practice during the cycle?
- Coach: What's holding them back? Fear? Lack of confidence?
- Offer: Let them co-lead one more cycle before leading independently

---

## FAQ

### **"Can we compress the 6-month prep timeline?"**

**Short answer:** Not recommended.

**Long answer:** Each phase serves a purpose. Skipping steps leads to:
- Leaders launching unprepared
- Groups struggling with basics
- Multiplication stalling
- Burnout and dropout

If you MUST compress, minimum timeline is 16 weeks:
- Weeks 1-2: Dam Assessment
- Weeks 3-8: DNA Manual (6 weeks)
- Weeks 9-12: Launch Guide (compressed)
- Weeks 13-16: 8-Week Toolkit (compressed to 4 weeks, meeting 2x/week)

**But we strongly recommend the full 24-week timeline.**

---

### **"What if we only have 2 potential DNA leaders, not 4-6?"**

**Answer:** That's fine. Start with 2.

- They complete all prep together (cohort of 2)
- They launch 2 DNA groups (8 people total)
- After 12 months: 2 groups → 4 groups (16 people)
- Quality over quantity

---

### **"Can leaders skip the DNA Manual if they've been in the church for years?"**

**Answer:** No.

- The Manual teaches DNA-specific philosophy, not general discipleship
- Even mature believers need DNA's unique framework
- It builds cohesion among the leader cohort
- 6 weeks is a small investment for alignment

---

### **"Do second-generation leaders really skip all the prep?"**

**Answer:** Yes, mostly.

They've already:
- Experienced DNA tools for 12 months (no need for 8-Week Toolkit)
- Learned DNA philosophy by living it (no need for Manual)
- Watched the Launch Guide modeled (no need to study it)

They just:
- Complete Dam Assessment (optional but recommended)
- Take Readiness Quiz
- Multiply

**However:** If they score low on Readiness Quiz, they may need to revisit some prep materials.

---

### **"How much does this cost?"**

**Answer:** Minimal.

- Digital resources: FREE (via DNA Leaders Dashboard)
- Printed DNA Manuals: $15-20 each on Amazon
- Printed toolkits/guides: $50-100 per leader (optional)

**Total per leader: $0-150**

**Most expensive part:** Time investment (175-200 hours in Year 1)

---

### **"What's the difference between DNA and other small group curriculum?"**

**Answer:** Everything.

**Typical Small Groups:**
- Open-ended (no set end date)
- Fellowship-focused
- Low accountability
- One leader (no co-leader)
- Goal: Community

**DNA Groups:**
- Time-bound (12 months, then multiply)
- Discipleship-focused
- High accountability
- Co-leader model (multiplies leaders)
- Goal: Multiplication

**DNA is not curriculum—it's a culture.**
