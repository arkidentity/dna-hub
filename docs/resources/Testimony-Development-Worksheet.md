# **TESTIMONY DEVELOPMENT WORKSHEET**

## **Building Your Story of God's Faithfulness**

---

### **What is a Testimony?**

A testimony is your personal account of God's activity in your life. It's not just about salvation—it's about every moment God shows up, provides, heals, speaks, guides, or transforms.

**Why share testimonies?**

* They build faith (Romans 10:17)
* They overcome darkness (Revelation 12:11)
* They give God glory
* They connect with believers and non-believers alike

## **The STORY Framework**

Use this framework to build a clear, compelling testimony:

**S - STRUGGLE** (Before)
**T - TURNING POINT** (The Moment)
**O - OUTCOME** (After)

## **Quick Testimony Tips**

### **What makes a testimony POWERFUL:**

✅ **Specific** - "God provided $500 for rent" (not "God is just so good")
✅ **Concise** - 3-5 minutes max (not 20 minutes)
✅ **God-centered** - He's the hero, not you
✅ **Honest** - Include the struggle, not just the victory
✅ **Relatable** - Others can see themselves in your story
✅ **Hope-filled** - Points people to Jesus as the answer

### **What to avoid:**

❌ Vague generalities - "God is good" without specifics
❌ Making yourself the hero - "I finally figured it out"
❌ Over-spiritualizing - Using Christianese non-believers won't understand
❌ Rambling without structure - No clear beginning, middle, end
❌ Leaving out the struggle - Only sharing the victory makes it unrelatable

## **Practice Tips**

1. **Write it out first** - Use this worksheet to organize your thoughts
2. **Practice out loud** - Say your testimony to yourself in front of a mirror
3. **Time yourself** - Aim for 3-5 minutes for your main testimony, 2-3 minutes for recent "God moments"
4. **Get feedback** - Share with a trusted friend and ask: "Is this clear? Compelling? God-centered?"
5. **Refine it** - Based on feedback, adjust details, add specifics, or simplify
6. **Pray before sharing** - Ask God to use your story to build faith in others
