|---|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----|------------|

| 11 | Is my relationship with God growing or have I been going through the motions? | — | — | Be honest — not critical. What has distance looked like? What has closeness looked like? What's the difference? |
| 12 | What fear am I allowing to drive my decisions? | — | — | Name it. Fear of failure, rejection, the unknown? Hand it to God and ask what faith-based action looks like. |
| 13 | Where is God asking me to be obedient, and am I doing it? | — | — | There's often something you already know He's asking. Is there a step you've been putting off? |
| 14 | How am I doing in my closest relationships? | — | — | Think about your family, friendships, and community. Where do you need to invest more? Where is there unresolved tension? |

| 17 | What have I been avoiding that I need to face? | — | — | God often meets us in the places we'd rather not go. What conversation, decision, or emotion needs your attention? |
| 18 | Where am I measuring my worth by performance? | — | — | Your value isn't tied to your output. Where are you striving for approval — from God, others, or yourself? |
| 19 | What has God done in my past that I need to remember right now? | — | — | Israel was always told to remember. What is a specific moment of God's faithfulness that applies to what you're facing today? |

| 21 | What does the fruit of my life say about what I actually believe? | By their fruit you will recognize them. | Matthew 7:16 | Our actions reveal our deepest convictions. Does the pattern of your life reflect trust in God — or trust in yourself? |
| 22 | Am I more in love with Jesus today than I was a year ago? | — | — | If the answer is yes, what has deepened your love? If no — what has gotten in the way? Let that question be a conversation with Him. |
| 23 | Where do I need to repent today? | — | — | Repentance isn't shame — it's turning back. Ask the Holy Spirit to show you anything that needs to be confessed and released. |
| 24 | How is God shaping my character through what I'm currently walking through? | — | — | Hard seasons aren't wasted. What might He be building in you through this difficulty? Ask Him to help you see it. |
| 25 | What does God want me to know about myself today? | — | — | Ask Him directly. Then be quiet and listen. Write down whatever comes. |
