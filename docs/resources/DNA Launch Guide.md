## **Introduction**

You've completed the DNA Discipleship course. You understand the heart behind making disciples. Now what?

This guide is your practical roadmap from “I want to make disciples" to "I'm actively discipling." Think of this as your flight checklist—each phase has specific actions, conversations, and checkpoints to help you launch well.

**Remember**: Discipleship is both flow and structure. This guide provides the structure, but the Holy Spirit provides the life. Stay flexible, stay prayerful, stay dependent on God.

# 

# 

# **Quick Start Summary**

## **Timeline Overview**

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Milestone |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 0: Pre-Launch** | Weeks \-6 to 0 | Leader training & group formation | Co-leader secured, disciples invited, first meeting scheduled |
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Months 1-3 (Weeks 1-12) | Learning tools, building trust | Disciples master DNA tools, show vulnerability and teachability |
| **Phase 2: Growth** | Months 4-6 | Practicing tools, co-facilitating | Disciples leading regularly, taking ownership |
| **Phase 3: Multiplication** | Months 7-12 | Preparing to multiply | New DNA groups launched |

You don’t need to master this entire guide before you begin. Focus only on the current phase you’re in. Each phase builds on the last, and you’ll grow into the role as you go.

# 

# **PHASE 0:**

# **Pre-Launch** 

# **(Before You Start)**

## **Getting Yourself Ready**

### 

## **Checkpoint 1: Self-Assessment**

Before you invite anyone into discipleship, you need to honestly assess your own readiness. Answer these questions:

**Spiritual Readiness**

* \[ \] Am I consistently spending time with God personally? (Not perfect, but consistent)  
* \[ \] Am I walking in freedom from lifestyle sin? (Not sinless, but not in bondage)  
* \[ \] Do I have mature believers speaking into my life?  
* \[ \] Can I articulate the gospel clearly and confidently?  
* \[ \] Am I teachable and correctable?

**Relational Capacity**

* \[ \] How many close relationships can I handle well right now?  
* \[ \] Is my marriage/family life healthy and stable? (If applicable)  
* \[ \] Do I have margin in my weekly schedule for 3-5 hours of DNA commitment?  
* \[ \] Am I currently overcommitted? What needs to change?

**Emotional Health**

* \[ \] Can I handle conflict without shutting down or exploding?  
* \[ \] Am I able to receive feedback without becoming defensive?  
* \[ \] Do I live "unoffendable" or do I easily take offense?  
* \[ \] Am I willing to be vulnerable about my own struggles?

**If you answered “no” to multiple questions in any category**, that's not disqualifying—it just means you need to address those areas first. Talk to a leader. Get help. Don't rush this.

### ---

## **Checkpoint 2: Finding Your Co-Leader**

**Why you need a co-leader:**

* Shared workload prevents burnout  
* Different perspectives strengthen the group  
* Overlapping relationships create safety and accountability  
* Models healthy partnership to disciples

**Who makes a good co-leader?**

**They should be:**

* Spiritually mature (not perfect, but growing)  
* Faithful and reliable (proven track record)  
* Complementary to your gifting (different strengths)  
* In agreement with DNA vision and values  
* Someone you respect and trust their wisdom

**They should NOT be:**

* Someone you're romantically interested in (avoid confusion)  
* Someone you're currently in conflict with (resolve first)  
* Someone who is newer in their faith than your potential disciples  
* Someone who is unwilling to commit to the full process

**How to ask someone to co-lead:**

**Step 1**: Pray specifically for God to highlight someone  
**Step 2**: Have a casual conversation about discipleship  
**Step 3**: Ask directly: "I'm looking to start a DNA group. Would you pray about co-leading with me?"  
**Step 4**: Give them time to pray and decide (don't pressure)  
**Step 5**: If yes, meet to align on expectations, schedule, and approach

**Sample Conversation:**

"Hey, I've been thinking a lot about discipleship lately and I sense God is calling me to start a DNA group. I really value your walk with God and the way you invest in people. Would you be open to praying about co-leading with me? I think we could make a great team, and I'd love to have your partnership in this."

**What if they say no?**  
Don't take it personally. They may have legitimate reasons (capacity, calling, season of life). Thank them, ask them to pray about who might be a good fit, and keep seeking.

**What if you can't find a co-leader?**  
In rare cases, you may start without one—but actively keep looking. Pray for God to send someone who can step into that role within the first 3 months. Solo leadership is not sustainable long-term.

---

### 

## **Checkpoint 3: Setting Up Your Rhythms**

**Weekly Meeting Time**

* What day/time works for you AND your co-leader consistently?  
* Where will you meet? (Home, coffee shop, church building, online?)
* How long will meetings last? (We recommend 90 minutes)

**Communication Plan**

* What will you use for group chat? (Text, GroupMe, WhatsApp, etc.)  
* How often will you check in between meetings?  
* What's your response time expectation? (24 hours? Same day?)

**Additional Gatherings**

* When will you do meals, outreach, or social hangouts?  
* How often? (We recommend at least once a month outside of formal meetings)

**Duration Commitment**

* How long is this DNA group committed to meeting? (12 months is the standard expectation)
* When will you multiply? (Set a tentative date so everyone expects it)

### **Create a DNA Group Agreement** 

(3 different sample agreements at the back of the guide)

* Meeting time and location  
* Communication expectations  
* Commitment length  
* Multiplication goal  
* How to handle absences or conflicts

Everyone signs it. This isn't legalistic—it's honoring. It says "we're serious about this."

## **Checkpoint 4: Prayer Strategy**

**Discipleship begins in prayer, not in planning.**

Spend intentional time asking God:

* "Who do you want me to invest in?"  
* "Who is hungry and ready?"  
* "What do you want to accomplish in this group?"

**Jesus prayed all night before choosing His disciples** (Luke 6:12-13). You don't need all night, but don't skip this step.

**Create a prayer list:**

* Write down 5-10 names of people who come to mind  
* Pray over that list daily for 1-2 weeks  
* Ask God to confirm or redirect  
* Pay attention to who keeps coming to mind

**Ask God specific questions:**

* Is this person ready?  
* What do they need from me?  
* What will be challenging about discipling them?  
* How will this relationship grow me?

**Pray with your co-leader:**  
Set aside 30-60 minutes to pray together specifically about potential disciples. Listen to what the Holy Spirit highlights to each of you.

# 

# 

# 

# 

# **PHASE 0 (continued):**

# **The Invitation** 

# **(Weeks 1-6 of Pre-Launch)**

## **Testing the Soil and Planting Seeds**

This phase is about observation and initiation. You're not formally asking them to be discipled yet—you're testing receptivity and building connection.

---

### 

### **Week 1-2: The Coffee Conversation**

**Goal**: Get to know them and gauge their hunger for spiritual growth.

* Text or call: "Hey, I'd love to grab coffee and catch up."  
* Keep it casual—no pressure, no agenda initially  
* Meet somewhere comfortable (coffee shop, lunch, park)

**What to talk about:**

Start with normal life stuff, then naturally transition:

* "How's your walk with God been lately?"  
* "What's God been teaching you?"  
* "Do you feel like you're growing spiritually?"  
* "What's something you wish you understood better about God?"

**What you're listening for:**

* Are they hungry? (Do they light up when talking about God?)  
* Are they honest? (Admit struggles or give "church answers"?)  
* Are they curious? (Do they ask questions?)  
* Are they available? (Do they have margin in their life?)

**Red Flags:**

* They don't engage spiritual topics at all  
* They blame others for their spiritual state  
* They're drowning in chaos with no desire to change  
* They're defensive or dismissive

**Green Lights:**

* They express frustration with spiritual stagnation  
* They ask YOU questions about your walk  
* They're open about struggles  
* They mention wanting to grow or be challenged

**After the conversation:**

* Thank them for their time  
* Pray for them by name that week  
* Don't make any formal ask yet—just observe

### **Week 3-4: The Follow-Up**

**Goal**: Continue building connection and invite them into something practical.

**How to follow up:**

* Reach out within a few days: "Really enjoyed our conversation. Been praying for you this week."  
* Invite them to something low-pressure:  
  * "We're doing a worship night at our place this Friday. You should come."  
  * "Want to join me for \[outreach/service project\]?"  
  * "I'm meeting with a few people to pray this week. Would love for you to join."

**What you're watching:**

* Do they show up?  
* Do they engage or observe?  
* Do they follow up afterward?

**If they don't show up or respond:**

That's valuable information. They may not be ready. Don't chase—just note it and keep praying.

**If they DO engage:**

You're seeing green lights. Time to have a more direct conversation.

---

### 

### **Week 5-6: The Direct Conversation**

**Goal**: Clearly present the opportunity for discipleship and gauge their response.

**How to initiate:**

Text or call: "Hey, I've really enjoyed getting to know you better. Can we grab coffee again? I want to run something by you."

**The Conversation:**

Be clear and confident. Here's a sample script (adjust to your voice):

"I've been thinking and praying a lot about discipleship lately. God has been stirring in me a desire to invest deeply in a few people—to help them grow in their faith, understand the Bible better, and step into everything God has for them.

I've noticed that you seem hungry for more. You ask good questions, you're honest about where you're at, and I sense that God might be calling us to do this together.

\[Co-leader's name\] and I are starting a DNA group—it's basically intentional discipleship. We'd meet weekly for about an hour, do life together, dig into Scripture, pray for each other, and challenge each other to grow. It's not just a Bible study—it's life-on-life.

I don't know if this is something you're interested in, but I wanted to ask: Would you be open to being part of this? No pressure—I just want you to know the door is open if you're hungry for it."

**Let them respond.**

**Possible Responses:**

**1\. "Yes\! I've been wanting something like this."**  
 Great\! Move forward with expectations conversation (see next section).

**2\. "I'm interested, but can I think about it?"**  
 Absolutely. Give them a timeline: "Take a week to pray about it. Let's reconnect next… \[day\]."

**3\. "I don't think I have the time right now."**  
 Honor that. "I totally understand. If the season changes, let me know. I'll keep praying for you."

**4\. "What exactly does that look like?"**  
 Good question. Walk them through the DNA structure, time commitment, and expectations (see next section).

**5\. Hesitation or uncertainty:**  
 "I sense you're not sure. That's okay—this is a big commitment. What questions do you have?" Address concerns honestly.

### **Setting Expectations Together**

**If they say yes or want more details, have THIS conversation:**

**Time Commitment:**

* "We meet weekly for 90 minutes. We also have a group chat for encouragement and prayer throughout the week."
* "We'll do meals or hangouts at least once a month—it's not just formal meetings."
* "We're committing to 12 months. At the end, we multiply—meaning you'll be ready to start your own group."

**What We'll Do:**

* "We'll study Scripture together, pray for each other, work through life issues, and learn to hear God's voice."  
* "We'll use tools like prophetic roundtables, devotional times, and outreach activities."  
* "This is a safe place to be real—no performance, no judgment."

**What We Expect:**

* "We expect you to show up consistently. Life happens, but this needs to be a priority."  
* "We expect you to be honest—even when it's uncomfortable."  
* "We expect you to be teachable and open to correction."  
* "We expect you to pursue us too—don't just wait for us to reach out."

**What You Can Expect From Us:**

* "We'll be consistent and committed to your growth."  
* "We'll create a safe place for you to process and grow."  
* "We'll challenge you, but we'll also be patient with you."  
* "We'll celebrate your wins and walk with you through struggles."

**Ask directly:**  
"Does this sound like something you're ready to commit to?"

**If yes:** Set the first meeting date and send them the DNA Group Agreement to review.

**If hesitation:** "What's holding you back?" Address concerns.

Introduce one discipleship tool each week: These are explained in detail in the **90-Day Toolkit**.

* Week 2: 3D Journal (Assign Scripture for next week)  
* Week 3: 4D Prayer / In The Gap (Practice daily prayer rhythm)  
* Week 4: Foundation Doctrines (Pick 2-3 Creed Cards to discuss)  
* Weeks 5-12: Follow the 90-Day Toolkit week-by-week guide

**Application/Discussion (30 mins)**

* "What's one thing you'll do this week because of this?"

**Prayer (15 mins)**  
Pray for each other's specific needs

**Between meetings:**

* Text the group at least once during the week  
* Check in individually with your assigned disciple  
* Pray for them daily by name

## 

## **Month 2: Deepening Trust (Weeks 5-8)**

**Focus**: Move from surface-level to personal-level vulnerability.

**Follow the 90-Day Toolkit** for detailed week-by-week guidance:

* Week 5: Q\&A Deep Dive
* Week 6: Listening Prayer Circle
* Week 7: Outreach/Mission Activity
* Week 8: Testimony Time + Outreach Debrief

### **Week 5: Q\&A Deep Dive**

**Goal**: Address doubts, questions, and theological confusion.

**Structure:**

* "What questions about God or the Bible have you been afraid to ask?"  
* Open floor—no question is off-limits  
* Don't rush to answer—sometimes ask, "What do you think?"  
* If you don't know the answer, say so: "Great question. Let me research that and we'll talk next week."

**This builds trust**: They see you're not pretending to have all the answers.

### **Week 6: Listening Prayer Circle**

**Goal**: Learn to hear God for others.

**Structure:**

* Brief teaching on hearing God's voice
* Practice listening prayer in groups
* Share what God reveals with each person
* Encourage and build up one another

**What you're listening for:**

* Are disciples willing to step out in faith?
* Are they growing in confidence hearing from God?
* Are the words they share encouraging and aligned with Scripture?

### **Week 7: Outreach/Mission Activity**

**Goal**: Apply faith in the real world.

**Structure:**

* Go out as a group to serve, evangelize, or pray for others
* Options: prayer walk, serve at shelter, street evangelism, visit nursing home
* Debrief briefly after the activity

**What you're watching for:**

* Willingness to step outside comfort zones
* Boldness in sharing faith
* Evidence of Holy Spirit activity

### **Week 8: Testimony Time + Outreach Debrief**

**Goal**: Process the outreach experience and build powerful testimonies.

**Structure:**

* Debrief the Week 7 outreach (15 min): "What did you see God do?"
* Teach the STORY Framework for building testimonies (15 min)
* Workshop testimonies in pairs with feedback (30 min)
* Challenge disciples to share testimonies outside the group

**What you're listening for:**

* Can they recognize and articulate God's activity?
* Are they giving God credit (not themselves)?
* Are testimonies specific, compelling, and God-centered?

---

### **Weeks 9-12: Addressing Strongholds & Empowerment**

**Goal**: Begin addressing patterns, lies, and strongholds.

**How to approach this:**

* By now, you've observed patterns in their life (fear, insecurity, anger, etc.)

* Gently name what you see: "I've noticed that when \[situation\] happens, you \[response\]. Can we talk about that?"

* Use Scripture to expose the lie and present truth

* Pray for breakthrough

**Example:**

"I've noticed that you talk a lot about feeling unworthy. Where do you think that comes from? Because God's Word says you're chosen, loved, and worthy because of Jesus. What would it look like to believe that?"

**This is where connection before correction matters.**  
If you haven't built trust, they'll shut down. If you have, they'll receive it.

## 

## **Month 3: Empowerment Begins**

**Focus**: Start giving them opportunities to lead and practice.

### **Week 9: Let Them Lead Devotional**

**Goal**: Give them practice teaching and hearing from God.

**Structure:**

* Assign them a chapter of Scripture  
* They prepare and lead the 3D journal discussion  
* You and co-leader give feedback afterward

**What you're watching:**

* Can they prepare?  
* Do they show up ready?  
* How do they handle leading?

---

### **Week 10: Outreach/Mission Activity**

**Goal**: Apply faith in real-world context.

**Ideas:**

* Street evangelism  
* Serve at homeless shelter  
* Prayer walk through neighborhood  
* Visit hospital or nursing home

**Debrief afterward:**

* "What was that like for you?"  
* "What did you learn about God? About yourself?"  
* "What fears came up?"

---

### 

### **Week 11-12: Progress Check-In**

**Goal**: Measure growth and identify next steps.

**Structure:**

* Retake Life Assessment from Week 1  
* Compare answers: "What's changed?"  
* Celebrate growth  
* Identify areas still needing work  
* Set goals for next 3 months

**Ask directly:**

* "Do you feel like you're growing?"  
* "What's been most challenging?"  
* "What's been most helpful?"  
* "Is there anything we should adjust?"

---

## 

## 

## 

## **Phase 1: Foundation Checklist**

After completing all 12 weeks of the 90-Day Toolkit, evaluate whether disciples are ready for Phase 2:

* \[ \] Disciples showing up consistently (80%+ attendance)  
* \[ \] Engaging in group chat and communication  
* \[ \] Demonstrating vulnerability and trust  
* \[ \] Teachable and receiving correction well  
* \[ \] Practicing spiritual disciplines independently (3D Journal daily, 4D Prayer daily)  
* \[ \] Addressed at least one major stronghold or lie  
* \[ \] Mastered DNA tools (3D Journal, 4D Prayer, Listening Prayer, Creed Cards)  
* \[ \] Expressing readiness to lead or facilitate

**If 6+ are true: Move to Phase 2: Growth & Empowerment.**

**If fewer than 6:** Extend Phase 1 for another 4-6 weeks. Identify gaps and address them. Don't rush.

---

# 

# 

# 

# **PHASE 2:**

# **Growth & Empowerment** 

# **(Months 4-6)**

## **From Students to Practitioners**

This phase is about transitioning from "I'm learning" to "I'm doing."

---

## 

## **The Shift: From Teaching to Empowering**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: You did most of the teaching and leading using the 90-Day Toolkit. 

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6)**: They do more of the teaching and leading using Supplemental Lessons.

**Your role changes:**

* Less instructor, more coach  
* Less talking, more listening  
* Less answers, more questions

**Their role changes:**

* More responsibility  
* More initiative  
* More ownership

---

## **Giving Them "Reps"**

While watching game film helps athletes—they really get better by playing. Same with disciples.

**Ways to give them reps:**

**1\. Let them lead devotionals regularly**

* Rotate who prepares and teaches each week  
* Give feedback after: "What did you do well? What would you change?"

**2\. Let them lead listening prayer**

* They facilitate  
* They create the environment  
* You observe and coach

**3\. Let them lead prayer**

* Don't always open or close in prayer yourself  
* Let them steward the group's prayer time

**4\. Let them invite others into spiritual conversations**

* When you're doing outreach, let them take the lead  
* Step back and observe  
* Debrief afterward

**5\. Give them pastoral responsibility**

* Ask them to check in on each other during the week  
* Let them pray for each other outside of group time

---

## **Processing Failures and Setbacks**

**This phase WILL include failures.**

They'll lead a devotional and it'll flop.  
They'll try to pray for someone and feel like nothing happened.  
They'll miss a meeting or drop the ball on communication.

**Your job: Help them process failure as growth, not disqualification.**

**When they fail, ask:**

* "What did you learn?"  
* "What would you do differently next time?"  
* "How did this expose an area you need to grow in?"

**Normalize failure:**

* Share YOUR failures from when you were learning  
* Remind them: "You're not expected to be perfect—you're expected to be faithful."

**Don't rescue them from discomfort:**

* Let them sit in the awkwardness of a failed teaching  
* Let them feel the sting of dropping the ball  
* Then help them learn from it

## **Increasing Ownership**

**By Month 6, they should be:**

* Leading devotionals 50% of the time  
* Initiating spiritual conversations with each other  
* Praying for each other without prompting  
* Asking YOU for feedback (not waiting for you to give it)  
* Showing up prepared

**If they're not doing these things by Month 6:**

* Have a direct conversation: "I care about, and I want you to grow so you can experience everything God has for you. But I've noticed you're not taking as much ownership as I expected. What's going on?"  
* Address passivity or fear  
* Reset expectations if needed

---

## **Month 6 Evaluation**

**Have a formal check-in at the 6-month mark.**

**Ask each disciple:**

* "How do you feel about your growth over the last 6 months?"  
* "What's been most transformative?"  
* "What's still challenging for you?"  
* "Do you feel ready to start thinking about discipling someone else?"

**You and co-leader evaluate:**

* Are they ready to multiply in 3-6 months?  
* What still needs to happen before multiplication?  
* Do we need to extend this DNA group, or are we on track?

---

## 

## **Phase 2: Growth Checklist**

By the end of Month 6, disciples should be:

* \[ \] Leading devotionals confidently  
* \[ \] Initiating spiritual conversations  
* \[ \] Hearing from God and sharing what He's saying  
* \[ \] Showing emotional and spiritual maturity  
* \[ \] Handling correction well  
* \[ \] Demonstrating fruit of the Spirit  
* \[ \] Expressing desire to disciple others  
* \[ \] Consistent in spiritual disciplines (prayer, Scripture, worship)

**If most of these are true, move to Phase 3: Multiplication.**

**If not**, extend Phase 2 another 3 months.

# 

# 

# **PHASE 3:** 

# **Multiplication** 

# **(Months 7-12)**

## **Releasing Them for Success**

Multiplication is the goal. Don't let the group run indefinitely without a clear plan to release and multiply.

---

## 

## **Recognizing Readiness**

Use the **DNA Multiplication Readiness Checklist**:

**A disciple is ready to multiply when they can:**

* \[ \] Articulate the gospel clearly  
* \[ \] Lead themselves spiritually (consistent devotion)  
* \[ \] Handle correction with humility  
* \[ \] Initiate spiritual conversations  
* \[ \] Demonstrate fruit of the Spirit  
* \[ \] Express desire to disciple others  
* \[ \] Complete a full cycle (6-12 months)  
* \[ \] Show faithfulness in small things

**If they check most of these boxes, they're ready.**

## **The Multiplication Conversation**

**When to have it**: Month 9-10

**How to initiate:**

"Hey, can we talk about next steps? You've grown so much over the last 9 months. I think you're ready to start thinking about who YOU might disciple. How do you feel about that?"

**Possible responses:**

**1\. "I'm excited but nervous."**  
 Normal. Affirm their growth and coach them through the fear.

**2\. "I don't feel ready."**  
 Ask why. Address specific concerns. Sometimes it's humility; sometimes it's legitimate gaps.

**3\. "Who would I even disciple?"**  
 Help them start praying. Give them the same process you went through in Phase 1\.

**4\. "I'm ready. What do I do?"**  
 Walk them through the DNA Launch Guide (this document).

## **Helping Them Find Their First Disciple**

**Coach them through the process:**

* Pray with them about who to invite  
* Help them identify 2-3 potential people  
* Role-play the invitation conversation  
* Give feedback

**Let them make mistakes:**

* They might pick someone who isn't ready—that's okay  
* They'll learn from it  
* Be available to coach, but don't do it for them

---

## **Month 12: Official Multiplication**

**By Month 12, the DNA group should multiply.**

**What multiplication looks like:**

* You and your disciple each start a new DNA group  
* Co-leader and their disciple each start a new DNA group  
* Original group disbands (or meets occasionally for fellowship)

**Multiplication Meeting:**

* Celebrate what God has done  
* Share testimonies of growth  
* Commission them into their new groups  
* Pray over them  
* Set a date to check in 1 month later

**After multiplication:**

* Stay in touch  
* Meet for coffee occasionally  
* Be available when they need coaching  
* Celebrate their wins

## **Common Multiplication Mistakes**

**1\. Holding on too long**  
Some leaders don't want to let go. Release them. Trust God.

**2\. Multiplying too early**  
Some leaders rush multiplication before disciples are ready. Be patient.

**3\. Ghosting after multiplication**  
Stay in touch. They still need you—just in a different capacity.

**4\. Expecting perfection**  
They'll make mistakes as new leaders. That's okay. Mistakes are part of growth.

---

## **Ongoing Support After Multiplication**

**Your role shifts again:**

* From leader to mentor  
* From teacher to advisor  
* From constant presence to occasional guide

**How to stay connected:**

* Monthly check-in coffee  
* Respond when they text with questions  
* Pray for them regularly  
* Celebrate their multiplication when it happens

**The goal**: They become confident, independent disciple-makers who multiply again.

# 

# **Final Thoughts**

**Discipleship is messy.**  
People will disappoint you. You'll disappoint yourself. That's okay.

**Discipleship is slow.**  
It takes longer than you think. Be patient.

**Discipleship is worth it.**  
There's no greater joy than seeing someone step into their calling because you invested in them.

**You're not doing this alone.**  
God is the one who causes growth. You're just a gardener's assistant.

**Trust the process.**  
Follow this guide, stay prayerful, and adjust as needed.

---

## 

## **Spiritual Commitment**

**During Meetings:**

* Show up prepared (complete assignments, read Scripture, bring questions)  
* Be fully present (phones away, distractions minimized)  
* Participate actively (share, pray, engage—don't just observe)  
* Be vulnerable and honest about struggles, doubts, and victories

**Outside of Meetings:**

* Practice spiritual disciplines (prayer, Scripture, worship, service)

**Teachability:**

* We commit to being teachable and correctable  
* We will receive feedback with humility, not defensiveness  
* We understand that correction is an act of love, not criticism

## **Covenant Relationships**

**What This IS:**

* A safe place to be real without judgment  
* A community committed to truth spoken in love  
* A partnership where we give each other permission to question our lives  
* A discipleship journey that prepares us to disciple others

**What This IS NOT:**

* A casual hangout that breaks when life gets busy  
* A place where leaders control your decisions (you have autonomy)  
* A one-way street (leaders pour in, disciples just receive)  
* Therapy or professional counseling (we'll point you to help when needed)

## 

## **Expectations of Leaders**

**Leaders commit to:**

* Model what they teach  
* Be consistent and reliable  
* Create a safe environment for vulnerability  
* Provide biblical teaching and correction  
* Pray for disciples regularly  
* Be available for guidance between meetings  
* Walk in integrity and godliness

## **Expectations of Disciples**

**Disciples commit to:**

* Show up consistently and on time  
* Be honest about struggles and victories  
* Pursue leaders, not just wait to be pursued  
* Complete assignments and come prepared  
* Grow in spiritual disciplines outside the group  
* Receive correction with humility  
* Move toward the goal of multiplying (discipling others)

## **Multiplication Commitment**

**Timeline:**

* We commit to meeting together for \[6 / 9 / 12 months\] (circle one)  
* Our planned multiplication date: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Goal:**

* By the end of this DNA group, disciples will be equipped to start their own groups  
* Multiplication is not abandonment—it's release into calling  
* We will stay connected after multiplication, but in a different capacity

**Preparing for Multiplication:**

* Beginning at Month 6, we'll start praying about who to disciple next  
* By Month 9, disciples will identify potential people to invest in  
* By Month 12, new DNA groups will launch

## **Conflict Resolution**

**When conflict arises (and it will):**

* We commit to addressing issues directly, not through gossip  
* We will speak truth in love, assuming the best about each other  
* We will involve the whole group if one-on-one resolution doesn't work  
* We will prioritize reconciliation and unity

**Matthew 18 Principle:** If someone wrongs you, go to them first. If that doesn't resolve it, bring witnesses. If needed, involve the larger community.

## **Confidentiality**

What's shared in the group stays in the group, unless:

* Someone is in danger (self-harm, abuse, etc.)  
* Someone gives permission to share their story  
* Leaders need to consult with other mature leaders for wisdom

We will not gossip about each other or share private struggles outside the group without permission.

## **Grace and Flexibility**

**Life Happens:**

* We extend grace when unexpected circumstances arise  
* We communicate when we need flexibility  
* We don't let grace become an excuse for lack of commitment

**Adjustments:**

* If the schedule or structure isn't working, we'll discuss and adjust  
* This agreement is a living document—we can revisit and revise as needed

## **Our Commitment**

By signing below, we acknowledge that we have read, understood, and agree to honor this DNA Group Commitment. We enter into this covenant relationship with joy, humility, and expectation of what God will do in and through us.
