## Card Flow

| # | Type | Duration | Headline (content) | Sub-prompt | Scripture | Ref |
|---|------|----------|--------------------|------------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | INTRO | 40s | Welcome to Reveal Renounce Replace | Find a quiet place. Grab your journal and a pen. You're about to do some of the most important spiritual work you've done. God right here with you. | — | — |
| 2 | TEACH | 50s | What Is a Stronghold? | A stronghold is a lie you've believed so long it feels like truth. It shapes how you see yourself, how you relate to God, and what you think you deserve. It isn't loud — it's just always there. | — | — |
| 3 | TEACH | 55s | Three Steps: Reveal · Renounce · Replace | God reveals the lie. You speak it out and reject it. God replaces it with truth. Each step matters — don't skip ahead. This is a process, not a formula. Follow His lead. | — | — |
| 4 | TEACH | 65s | Why Replace Matters | Jesus is clear: driving out darkness is not enough. An empty house invites something worse. When we remove a lie, we must fill that space with His truth — or we become more vulnerable, not less. | When an impure spirit comes out of a person… it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. | Matthew 12:43–45 |
| 5 | LISTEN | 65s | Step 1 — Reveal | Ask God this out loud or in your heart: "Is there a lie I've been believing about God, myself or even someone else?" Then wait. Don't filter it. Don't argue with what surfaces. Write it down. | — | — |
| 6 | RESPOND | 130s | Listen. Write What He Shows You. | Take your time. Write a word, a sentence, a memory — whatever surfaces. Don't judge what comes. This is a safe space between you and God. He sees the root. Let Him show you. | — | — |
| 7 | LISTEN | 140s | Go Deeper If He's Still Speaking | Ask Him: "How long have I believed this? Where did it come from?" Let Him trace the root. Don't rush.  Write anything He shows you. | — | — |
| 8 | DECLARE | 60s | Step 2 — Renounce | This step must be spoken out loud. Your voice carries authority here. You are not just thinking different thoughts — you are breaking an agreement. When you're ready, read the next card aloud. | — | — |
| 9 | DECLARE | 105s | Speak This Aloud — Fill In the Blank | "In the name of Jesus, I renounce the lie that [the lie God revealed]. I break agreement with it right now. I choose to no longer give it power over my mind, my heart, or my identity. It has no hold on me. I am free." | — | — |
| 10 | LISTEN | 60s | Step 3 — Replace | Now say this: "God, I give you this lie, What do you give me in return?" Wait for Him. It may come as a scripture, a single word, or a simple sentence. He always answers. Don't fill the silence — just receive. | — | — |
| 11 | RESPOND | 130s | Receive the Truth. Write It Down. | Write down exactly what He gives you — this is your weapon. Write it clearly and specifically. You'll return to this truth again and again. Take all the time you need. | — | — |
| 12 | TEACH | 90s | Truth Requires Repetition to Take Root | The lie took years to form. Truth renews the mind through repetition, not one moment. Read this passage slowly. Let it agree with what He just spoke to you. | Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is — his good, pleasing and perfect will. | Romans 12:2 |
| 13 | DECLARE | 95s | Declare the Truth Out Loud | Speak this aloud, filling in the truth God gave you: "I declare that [the truth He gave]. This is who God says I am. I choose to agree with Him. His Word is final. My feelings must come into alignment with His truth." | — | — |
| 14 | INTRO | 110s | Well Done. Keep the Truth Close. | What you did today took real courage. The enemy will test the truth you just received — probably soon. When he does, speak it again. Write it somewhere you'll see it daily. Pray: "Holy Spirit, keep what You revealed alive in me." | So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. | John 8:36 |
