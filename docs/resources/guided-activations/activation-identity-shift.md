## Card Flow

| # | Type | Duration | Headline (content) | Sub-prompt | Scripture | Ref |
|---|------|----------|--------------------|------------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | INTRO | 30s | Welcome to Identity Shift | Grab a journal or sheet of paper and get ready to right down some thoughts.  We are looking for the real answer not the right answer. So be honest.| — | — |
| 2 | TEACH | 40s | The Mirror Test | When you look in the mirror, what do you see? Not the Christian answer. Not what you're supposed to say. The real, unfiltered answer. That answer reveals a lot — including some things God wants to heal. | — | — |
| 3 | RESPOND | 160s | Write Your Honest Answer | Open your journal. At the top write: "When I look in the mirror, I see..." Then finish it honestly. This isn't for anyone else. No performance here — just truth. | — | — |
| 4 | LISTEN | 55s | Now Let's Ask God | Ask Him out loud: say "God, when You look at me, what do You see?" Then be still. Just listen. Don't rush to fill the silence. What He says may surprise you. | — | — |
| 5 | RESPOND | 180s | Listen and Write What He Says | Give Him time. Write down whatever comes — a word, a feeling, a scripture, an image. Don't dismiss what you receive. Don't argue with it. Just write. He is speaking. | — | — |
| 6 | TEACH | 65s | The Identity Gap | You now have two answers. Look at both and compare. What do you notice about your answer vs what God says about you? This is where the breakthrough happens | — | — |
| 7 | TEACH | 55s | We need an identity Shift| Why is it that God perspective is from completion and our perspective is imcomplete and lacking in truth? | — | — |
| 8 | TEACH | 65s | Meet Gideon | Gideon was hiding in a winepress — the weakest man in the weakest clan — when God showed up and called him "mighty man of valor." His first response? "Are you sure you have the right person?" Sound familiar? | When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon, he said, "The Lord is with you, mighty warrior." "Pardon me, my lord," Gideon replied, "but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us?" | Judges 6:12–13 |
| 9 | TEACH | 60s | False Humility? | When you reject what God says about you, you're not being humble — you're exalting your opinion above His. True humility is agreeing with what God says. Disagreeing with God about who you are is pride in disguise. | — | — |
| 10 | TEACH | 60s | False Humility? | When you reject what God says about you, you're not being humble — you're exalting your opinion above His. True humility is agreeing with what God says. Disagreeing with God about who you are is pride in disguise. | — | — |
| 11 | DECLARE | 55s | Say This Out Loud | Speak this aloud and say it like you mean it: "I am who Jesus says I am." Not who your past says. Not who your failures say. Not who your fears say. Say it with power "I am who Jesus says I am." | — | — |
| 12 | LISTEN | 80s | Now Let's Ask God Again| "God, when You look at me, what do You see?" write down everything you hear from the Holy Spirit. Even if it doesnt make sense yet. maybe this leads to other questions you want to ask God. | — | — |
| 13 | Scripture| 30s | Your True Idenity | I AM COMPLETE: Colossians 2:10 NKJV And you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power. 
| 14 | Scripture| 30s | Your True Idenity | I AM CHOSEN: 1 Thessalonians 1:4 NLT We know, dear brothers and sisters, that God loves you and has chosen you to be his own people.
| 15 | Scripture| 30s | Your True Idenity | I AM LOVED: John 15:9 NIV As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. 
| 16 | Scripture| 30s | Your True Idenity | I AM MORE THAN A CONQUEROR:  Romans 8:37 NKJV Yet In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. 
| 17 | Scripture| 30s | Your True Idenity | I AM FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE: Psalm 139:14 NIV I will praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvelous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well.  
| 18 | DECLARE | 75s | Final Declaration — Speak It Over Yourself | Speak this aloud: "I choose today to see myself the way God sees me. I am not what my past says. I am not what my fears say. I am who Jesus says I am — and I will agree with Him until my feelings catch up with the truth." | — | — |
| 19 | INTRO | 70s | You Did the Work. Now Walk In It. | Identity doesn't shift in a moment — it shifts through daily agreement. Keep your Battle Plan somewhere visible. When you feel like hiding, remember Gideon. God called him a mighty warrior before he believed it. He's calling you the same. | See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! | 1 John 3:1 |
