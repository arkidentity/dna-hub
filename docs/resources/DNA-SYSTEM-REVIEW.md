# DNA SYSTEM REVIEW & RECOMMENDATIONS
**Systematic Analysis of DNA Discipleship Documents**
*Date: 2026-01-29*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I've completed a thorough review of your three main DNA documents:
1. **DNA Discipleship Manual** (6 sessions)
2. **DNA Launch Guide** (Phase 0-3)
3. **90-Day Toolkit** (Overview + Month 1-3)

**Overall Assessment:** The system is 95% cohesive and well-structured. The documents work together beautifully with clear progression and consistent messaging. However, I've identified several timeline inconsistencies, terminology variations, and opportunities for simplification.

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS: Timeline Inconsistencies

### 🚨 MAJOR ISSUE #1: Phase Duration Confusion

**Problem:** Different documents reference different timelines for the same phases.

**DNA Launch Guide says:**
- Phase 0: Weeks -6 to 0 (6 weeks)
- Phase 1: Months 1-3 (Weeks 1-12)
- Phase 2: Months 4-6
- Phase 3: Months 7-12

**90-Day Toolkit Overview says:**
- Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-3 / 90 Days) ✓ Consistent
- Phase 2: Growth & Empowerment (Months 4-6) ✓ Consistent
- Phase 3: Multiplication Prep (Months 7-12) ✓ Consistent

**BUT... DNA Discipleship Manual (Session 6) says:**
- "The DNA Launch Guide will walk you step-by-step from 'I want to make disciples' to 'I'm actively discipling someone.'"
- **Phase 0: Pre-Launch (6 weeks)** ✓ Consistent
- **Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)** ✓ Consistent
- **Phase 2: Growth (Months 4-6)** ✓ Consistent
- **Phase 3: Multiplication (Months 7-12)** ✓ Consistent

✅ **Actually, this is CONSISTENT across all documents!** My initial concern was unfounded.

---

### 🚨 MAJOR ISSUE #2: DNA Group Duration Contradictions

**DNA Discipleship Manual (Session 2) says:**
> "In this model, you will spend **6 months to a year** with the same group."

**DNA Launch Guide Phase 0 says:**
> Duration Commitment: "How long is this DNA group committed to meeting? (**6-12 months recommended**)"

**90-Day Toolkit Month 3 says:**
> "By Month 12, the DNA group should multiply."

**DNA Group Agreement Templates say:**
> "We commit to meeting together for [6 / 9 / **12 months**] (circle one)"

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **Standardize to 12 months** as the clear expectation
- Change Session 2 language to: "In this model, you will spend **12 months** with the same group (minimum 6 months for some situations)."

---

### 🚨 ISSUE #3: Weekly Meeting Time References

**DNA Discipleship Manual (Session 4) says:**
> "Ideally, groups should meet consistently at the same time each week. But this is not always feasible. We suggest for **one hour or longer** if the Spirit leads."

**DNA Launch Guide Quick Start says:**
> "Duration: _____ (typically **60-90 minutes**)"

**90-Day Toolkit Month 1 Week 1 says:**
> "Week 1: First Official Meeting - **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**"

**All 90-Day Toolkit meetings are structured for 90 minutes**

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **Standardize to 90 minutes** as the recommended meeting length
- Update Session 4 to say: "We suggest meeting for **90 minutes** (minimum 60 minutes if needed)."

---

## TIMELINE MAPPING: How Documents Connect

### CORRECT SEQUENCE FOR USERS:

```
PRE-LAUNCH (Before DNA Group Starts)
├─ DNA Discipleship Manual (6 Sessions)
│  └─ Completes BEFORE Phase 0
│
├─ DNA Launch Guide: Phase 0 (6 weeks)
│  ├─ Self-assessment
│  ├─ Find co-leader
│  ├─ Set up rhythms
│  ├─ Prayer strategy
│  ├─ Invite disciples
│  └─ Schedule first meeting
│
PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-12 / Months 1-3)
├─ 90-Day Toolkit: Overview
├─ 90-Day Toolkit: Month 1 (Weeks 1-4)
├─ 90-Day Toolkit: Month 2 (Weeks 5-8)
└─ 90-Day Toolkit: Month 3 (Weeks 9-12)
│
PHASE 2: GROWTH & EMPOWERMENT (Months 4-6)
└─ DNA Launch Guide: Phase 2 (brief guidance)
│
PHASE 3: MULTIPLICATION PREP (Months 7-12)
└─ DNA Launch Guide: Phase 3 (brief guidance)
```

**ISSUE:** This sequence is IMPLIED but never explicitly stated.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Add a clear "Document Roadmap" section to the DNA Launch Guide Introduction:

```markdown
## How to Use the DNA Documents

**BEFORE YOUR DNA GROUP STARTS:**
1. Complete the DNA Discipleship Manual (6 sessions) - prepares your heart
2. Work through DNA Launch Guide Phase 0 (6 weeks) - prepares your group

**DURING YOUR DNA GROUP:**
3. Use the 90-Day Toolkit for your first 12 weeks (Phase 1)
4. Follow DNA Launch Guide for Phases 2-3 (Months 4-12)
```

---

## TERMINOLOGY INCONSISTENCIES

### Issue #1: "DNA Group" vs "DNA groups"
- Capitalization varies throughout documents
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Standardize to "DNA group" (lowercase) except when starting a sentence

### Issue #2: "Co-leader" vs "Co-Leader"
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Standardize to "co-leader" (lowercase)

### Issue #3: "3D Journal" vs "3-D Journal" vs "3D journal"
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Standardize to "3D Journal" (capitalized J)

### Issue #4: "4D Prayer" vs "In The Gap"
- Both terms used interchangeably, which is confusing
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Use "4D Prayer (In The Gap)" on first reference, then either term thereafter

### Issue #5: "Life Assessment" vs "Personal Dam Assessment"
- DNA Discipleship Manual Session 6 mentions "Personal Dam Assessment"
- 90-Day Toolkit calls it "Life Assessment"
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Clarify these are TWO DIFFERENT assessments:
  - **Personal Dam Assessment** = taken BEFORE completing the 6-session manual
  - **Life Assessment** = taken Week 1 and Week 12 of the 90-Day Toolkit

---

## PHASE 0 INCONSISTENCIES

### Issue: Pre-Launch Duration Varies

**DNA Discipleship Manual Session 6 says:**
> "Phase 0: Pre-Launch (6 weeks)"

**DNA Launch Guide Phase 0 title says:**
> "PHASE 0: Pre-Launch (Before You Start)"

**DNA Launch Guide Phase 0 section says:**
> "PHASE 0 (continued): The Invitation (Weeks 1-6 of Pre-Launch)"

**90-Day Toolkit Overview says:**
> "Phase 0: Pre-Launch | Weeks -6 to 0"

✅ **This is actually consistent** - 6 weeks before Week 1 of Phase 1

**RECOMMENDATION:** Make it even clearer by adding to DNA Launch Guide:
> "Phase 0 takes approximately **6 weeks** before your first DNA group meeting."

---

## CONTENT OVERLAPS & REDUNDANCIES

### 1. The "Two by Two" Model Explained Multiple Times

**DNA Discipleship Manual Session 2:**
> "1 Leader + 1 Co-leader + 2 Disciples = DNA Group"

**DNA Launch Guide Phase 0 doesn't explicitly state the 4-person model**

**90-Day Toolkit doesn't state it either**

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add this foundational structure explicitly to the DNA Launch Guide Introduction:
> "The DNA group structure is simple: **1 Leader + 1 Co-leader + 2 Disciples = 4 people total**"

---

### 2. Creed Cards Teaching Repeated

**DNA Discipleship Manual Session 2:**
> Brief mention of "Creed Cards" as a foundation doctrines tool

**90-Day Toolkit Month 1 Week 4:**
> Full 90-minute teaching on Creed Cards with "STORY Framework"

**ISSUE:** The acronym "STORY Framework" is never defined in the context of Creed Cards.

**Wait... I'm confused.** Let me re-read Week 4.

Actually, Week 4 uses a **5-step process** for Creed Cards:
1. DISCUSS (before flipping)
2. DEFINE (flip and read)
3. DEEPEN (compare and dig into Scripture)
4. DISCUSS (reflection question)
5. DO IT AGAIN (review regularly)

The "STORY Framework" is mentioned in **90-Day Toolkit Month 2 Week 8** for **Testimony Development**, not Creed Cards.

✅ **This is NOT a problem.** Ignore my confusion.

---

## SIMPLIFICATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. Phase 0 is Too Detailed for a Pre-Launch Phase

**Current Structure:**
- Checkpoint 1: Self-Assessment (10+ questions)
- Checkpoint 2: Finding Your Co-Leader (detailed process)
- Checkpoint 3: Setting Up Your Rhythms (meeting time, communication plan, etc.)
- Checkpoint 4: Prayer Strategy (1-2 weeks of daily prayer)
- Week 1-2: The Coffee Conversation
- Week 3-4: The Follow-Up
- Week 5-6: The Direct Conversation
- Setting Expectations Together (detailed conversation guide)

**FEEDBACK:** This is exhaustive and might overwhelm new leaders.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Create a **simplified one-page checklist** version for leaders who don't need all the hand-holding:

```markdown
## Phase 0: Quick Start Checklist

**PREPARE YOURSELF (Week 1-2)**
☐ Complete self-assessment
☐ Identify and invite a co-leader
☐ Set meeting schedule and location

**PRAY & IDENTIFY (Week 3-4)**
☐ Pray daily for 2 weeks
☐ Create list of 3-5 potential disciples
☐ Have informal coffee conversations

**INVITE & COMMIT (Week 5-6)**
☐ Have the direct discipleship conversation
☐ Set expectations clearly
☐ Have them sign DNA Group Agreement
☐ Schedule Week 1 meeting

**For detailed guidance on each step, see the full Phase 0 section.**
```

---

### 2. The 90-Day Toolkit is Dense

**Current Structure:**
- Overview document (10 pages)
- Month 1 document (35 pages)
- Month 2 document (40 pages)
- Month 3 document (55 pages)

**Total: 140 pages for 12 weeks**

**FEEDBACK:** This is A LOT. Leaders might feel overwhelmed.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Create **simplified leader guides** for each week:

```markdown
## WEEK 1 LEADER GUIDE (1-page version)

**BEFORE MEETING:**
☐ Send Life Assessment links to disciples
☐ Pray for each disciple by name
☐ Have wifi ready for online assessment

**MEETING FLOW (90 min):**
1. Welcome & Vision (10 min)
2. Complete Life Assessment (25 min)
3. Share & Discuss (40 min)
4. Closing Prayer (10 min)

**AFTER MEETING:**
☐ Review results in dashboard
☐ Debrief with co-leader
☐ Text each disciple encouragement

**For detailed teaching notes, discussion prompts, and coaching tips, see the full Month 1 guide.**
```

---

### 3. Too Many Assessment Types

**Mentioned Assessments:**
1. Personal Dam Assessment (Session 6)
2. DNA Readiness Quiz (Session 6)
3. Life Assessment Week 1 (90-Day Toolkit)
4. Life Assessment Week 12 (90-Day Toolkit)
5. Spiritual Gifts Assessment (Week 11)
6. DNA Multiplication Readiness Checklist (Phase 3)

**FEEDBACK:** This is confusing. Users won't know which assessment to take when.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Create an **Assessment Roadmap** document:

```markdown
## DNA Assessment Roadmap

**BEFORE DNA Discipleship Manual:**
1. Personal Dam Assessment - identifies 7 potential blockages to growth

**AFTER DNA Discipleship Manual (Session 6):**
2. DNA Readiness Quiz - confirms you're ready to lead a DNA group

**WEEK 1 OF DNA GROUP:**
3. Life Assessment (Week 1) - baseline measurement of spiritual health

**WEEK 11 OF DNA GROUP:**
4. Spiritual Gifts Assessment - discover your spiritual gifts

**WEEK 12 OF DNA GROUP:**
5. Life Assessment (Week 12) - measure growth over 12 weeks

**BEFORE MULTIPLICATION (Month 9-10):**
6. DNA Multiplication Readiness Checklist - confirms disciples are ready to launch their own groups
```

---

## LANGUAGE & CLARITY ISSUES

### 1. "You" vs "We" Inconsistency

**DNA Discipleship Manual** uses "you" (speaking TO the reader)
**DNA Launch Guide** uses "you" (speaking TO the reader)
**90-Day Toolkit** mixes "you" (speaking TO the leader) and "disciples" (speaking ABOUT the disciples)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Standardize to speaking TO the leader ("you") and ABOUT disciples ("your disciples," "they")

---

### 2. Overly Spiritual Language in Some Sections

**Example from 90-Day Toolkit Month 3 Week 9:**
> "This is Spirit-led deliverance. We're not the ones doing the work—God is. We're just facilitating an environment where you can hear Him clearly and respond in obedience."

**FEEDBACK:** This is beautifully written but might intimidate leaders who don't feel "spiritual enough."

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add grounding statements like:
> "Don't worry if this feels unfamiliar—you're learning. The Holy Spirit will guide you. Just follow the steps and trust the process."

---

### 3. Assume ARK Identity Familiarity

**Example from DNA Discipleship Manual Session 2:**
> "You do not need to be an ARK Trainer but you should have experience with our core classes. ID3, Freedom, Sabbath and The Bridge."

**FEEDBACK:** What if someone from another church is using these materials?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add a footnote:
> "If you're not part of ARK Identity, ensure you have solid grounding in New Covenant theology from a trusted source."

---

## CONTENT GAPS

### 1. What Happens AFTER Phase 3?

**DNA Launch Guide Phase 3** ends with:
> "After multiplication: Stay in touch, meet for coffee occasionally, be available when they need coaching."

**FEEDBACK:** Then what? Do I start another group? Do I mentor multiple groups?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add a "Phase 4: Ongoing Multiplication" section:
```markdown
## After Your First DNA Group Multiplies

**Option 1: Start Another DNA Group**
- Begin Phase 0 again with new disciples
- Your former disciples are now your peer network

**Option 2: Mentor Multiple DNA Leaders**
- Meet monthly with your multiplied leaders
- Coach them through challenges
- Celebrate their wins

**Option 3: Train DNA Leaders**
- Lead cohorts through the DNA Discipleship Manual
- Prepare multiple leaders to launch groups simultaneously

**The goal: Exponential multiplication across your city.**
```

---

### 2. What If Someone Drops Out?

**Current documents** briefly mention:
- "Give them a choice: Recommit or gracefully exit" (90-Day Toolkit Month 2)

**FEEDBACK:** What's the graceful exit process? How do I handle this without damaging the relationship?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add a troubleshooting section to the DNA Launch Guide:

```markdown
## When a Disciple Wants to Leave

**Have a private conversation:**
1. "I've noticed you seem less engaged. What's going on?"
2. Listen without judgment
3. "Is this still the right season for you to be in a DNA group?"

**If they want to leave:**
- Thank them for their honesty
- Affirm the growth they've already experienced
- Release them without guilt
- Keep the door open: "If the season changes, you're always welcome back."

**If they want to recommit:**
- Reset expectations clearly
- Identify what needs to change
- Give them a specific timeframe to demonstrate commitment

**Don't take it personally.** Not everyone is in the right season for deep discipleship.
```

---

### 3. Handling Spiritual Warfare

**DNA Launch Guide Phase 0** says:
> "Expect spiritual warfare—this will be uncomfortable"

**90-Day Toolkit Month 3** says:
> "Expect spiritual warfare. The enemy will try to reclaim ground."

**FEEDBACK:** HOW do I handle spiritual warfare? What does that look like practically?

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add a "Spiritual Warfare Guide" appendix:

```markdown
## Recognizing & Responding to Spiritual Warfare

**Signs of spiritual warfare:**
- Unusual conflicts between group members
- Leaders or disciples experiencing depression, anxiety, or fear
- Sudden life crises (financial, relational, health)
- Disciples missing meetings after breakthrough
- Technology failures during important meetings

**How to respond:**
1. **Pray protection** over each disciple by name daily
2. **Bind and loose** (Matthew 18:18) - bind the enemy's work, loose God's purposes
3. **Speak truth** - remind disciples of their identity in Christ
4. **Fast if needed** - some battles require fasting (Mark 9:29)
5. **Get support** - don't fight alone; ask other leaders to pray

**Important:** Don't be afraid. You have authority in Christ. The enemy is defeated.
```

## STRUCTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Create a Master Navigation Document

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add a **"DNA System Overview"** document that maps the entire journey:

```markdown
# DNA SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## The Three Main Documents

### 1. DNA Discipleship Manual (6 Sessions)
**Who:** Future DNA leaders
**When:** BEFORE starting a DNA group
**Duration:** 6 weeks (one session per week)
**Purpose:** Prepares your heart and theology for discipleship

### 2. DNA Launch Guide
**Who:** DNA leaders ready to start a group
**When:** During Phase 0 (pre-launch) through Phase 3 (multiplication)
**Duration:** 12+ months
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide from formation to multiplication

### 3. 90-Day Toolkit
**Who:** DNA leaders in their first 12 weeks with disciples
**When:** Phase 1 (Weeks 1-12)
**Duration:** 3 months
**Purpose:** Detailed lesson plans for building foundation

## The Journey Timeline

**Weeks -6 to 0: Pre-Launch (Phase 0)**
→ Complete DNA Discipleship Manual (if not done already)
→ Follow DNA Launch Guide Phase 0
→ Find co-leader, invite disciples, set rhythms

**Weeks 1-4: Month 1 - Foundation**
→ Use 90-Day Toolkit Month 1
→ Life Assessment, 3D Journal, 4D Prayer, Creed Cards

**Weeks 5-8: Month 2 - Deepening**
→ Use 90-Day Toolkit Month 2
→ Q&A, Listening Prayer, Outreach, Testimony

**Weeks 9-12: Month 3 - Breakthrough**
→ Use 90-Day Toolkit Month 3
→ Breaking Strongholds, Identity, Spiritual Gifts, Growth Measurement

**Months 4-6: Phase 2 - Co-Leadership**
→ Follow DNA Launch Guide Phase 2
→ Disciples begin co-facilitating meetings

**Months 7-12: Phase 3 - Multiplication Prep**
→ Follow DNA Launch Guide Phase 3
→ Disciples prepare to launch their own groups

**Month 12+: Multiplication**
→ DNA group multiplies into 2-4 new groups
→ Original leader starts again or mentors new leaders
```

---

### 2. Consistent Document Headers

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add standardized headers to every document:

```markdown
# [DOCUMENT NAME]
**Part of the DNA Discipleship System**
*For use with [target audience]*

**Related Documents:**
- [Link to previous document in sequence]
- [Link to next document in sequence]

**Questions or Support:** info@arkidentity.com | app.arkidentity.com
```

---

## USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Add Visual Flowcharts

**RECOMMENDATION:** Create simple flowcharts for:
- The overall DNA journey (Pre-Launch → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Multiplication)
- The weekly meeting structure
- The decision tree for "Is this disciple ready to multiply?"

---

### 2. Add "Quick Win" Sections

**RECOMMENDATION:** For leaders who feel overwhelmed, add "Start Here" boxes:

```markdown
## 🚀 QUICK START: Don't Have Time to Read Everything?

**DO THESE THREE THINGS THIS WEEK:**
1. Complete your own 3D Journal daily for 7 days
2. Text 3 potential co-leaders and ask them to coffee
3. Read Phase 0 Checkpoint 1 (Self-Assessment)

**Then come back and read the full guide when you have more time.**
```

---

### 3. Add Troubleshooting FAQs to Each Month

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add a "Common Problems This Month" section:

**Example for Month 1:**
```markdown
## Month 1 Troubleshooting

**Q: A disciple isn't doing the daily 3D Journal.**
A: Have a private conversation. Ask what's blocking them. Remove barriers. If they still won't commit, they may not be ready.

**Q: The Life Assessment took way longer than 25 minutes.**
A: That's okay. Extend the meeting time or finish the discussion next week. Don't rush this.

**Q: Someone got emotional during Week 1 sharing.**
A: This is normal and good. Sit with them. Offer tissues. Pray quietly. Don't rush them.
```

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Do These First)

1. **Standardize DNA group duration to 12 months** (Session 2, Launch Guide, Toolkit)
2. **Standardize weekly meeting time to 90 minutes** (Session 4, Launch Guide, Toolkit)
3. **Create a "Document Roadmap" section** in DNA Launch Guide Introduction
4. **Add an "Assessment Roadmap"** to clarify which assessment to take when
5. **Add "What Happens After Phase 3?"** section to DNA Launch Guide

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS (Do These Next)

6. **Create simplified one-page leader guides** for each week of the 90-Day Toolkit
7. **Add a "Spiritual Warfare Guide"** appendix
8. **Add "When a Disciple Wants to Leave"** troubleshooting section
9. **Standardize terminology** (co-leader, 3D Journal, 4D Prayer, DNA group)
10. **Add grounding statements** to overly spiritual sections

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS (Nice to Have)

11. **Create visual flowcharts** for the DNA journey
12. **Add "Quick Start" boxes** for time-strapped leaders
13. **Add "Troubleshooting FAQs"** to each month of the Toolkit
14. **Add standardized headers** to every document
15. **Create a "DNA System Overview"** master navigation document

---

## CONCLUSION

Your DNA system is **exceptionally well-developed** and cohesive. The three main documents work together beautifully with only minor inconsistencies. The biggest opportunities for improvement are:

1. **Clarifying timelines** (12 months standard, 90-minute meetings)
2. **Adding navigation aids** (roadmaps, flowcharts, master overview)
3. **Simplifying for overwhelmed leaders** (one-page guides, quick starts)
4. **Filling content gaps** (post-multiplication, dropouts, spiritual warfare)

**Overall Grade: A-**

The system is ready to use as-is, but these improvements would make it **even more accessible and effective** for leaders at all experience levels.
