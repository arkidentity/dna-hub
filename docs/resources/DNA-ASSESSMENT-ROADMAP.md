## 💡 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Assessment Best Practices

**1. Take assessments DURING meetings (not before)**
- Life Assessments (Week 1 and 12) are completed live as a group
- This creates shared experience and vulnerability
- Leaders can support anyone who gets stuck

**2. Be honest, not "spiritual"**
- Answer based on reality, not how you wish things were
- Assessments only help if you're truthful
- No one is grading you—this is for YOUR growth

**3. Leaders take assessments too**
- Model vulnerability by completing alongside disciples
- Your results help you identify your own growth areas
- You're not above the process—you're in it together

**4. Results are private**
- Only leaders see individual assessment results (via Dashboard)
- Disciples choose what to share with the group
- Create a safe, judgment-free environment

**5. Don't skip assessments**
- Each one serves a strategic purpose in the DNA journey
- Skipping assessments means missing key growth insights
- The system works best when followed sequentially

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I have to take the Personal Dam Assessment?**
A: It's optional but highly recommended. Many leaders discover breakthrough by addressing "dams" before they start leading.

**Q: What if I "fail" the DNA Readiness Quiz?**
A: You can't fail—it's a diagnostic tool. Low scores simply mean "not yet." Address the gaps and retake it when ready.

**Q: Can disciples see each other's Life Assessment results?**
A: No. Results are private between the disciple and leaders. Disciples share voluntarily during Week 1 and 12 discussions.

**Q: What if someone scores low on Spiritual Gifts Assessment?**
A: There are no "low" scores—just different designs. Some people score high in Tier 1 (serving), others in Tier 2 (supernatural). Both are valuable.

**Q: How accurate is the Week 1 vs Week 12 comparison?**
A: Very accurate IF disciples are honest on both assessments. The comparison shows real growth patterns over 12 weeks.

**Q: What if a disciple isn't ready to multiply after 12 months?**
A: That's okay\! The Multiplication Readiness Checklist helps you decide together whether to extend Phase 3 or proceed with multiplication.
