# Flow Assessment Debrief Guide
### A Pastor's Guide to One-on-One Debriefing

---

## Purpose of This Guide

The Flow Assessment is a personal diagnostic tool — designed to be honest before God, not performed for an audience. **Results are private to the person who took it.** This debrief is not about a pastor reviewing someone's answers. It is about a pastor asking the right questions so the leader can interpret and apply their own results.

Your role in this conversation is not analyst. It is shepherd.

Come curious. Come prayerful. Let them lead you into what God is already surfacing.

---

## Before the Meeting

**Prepare yourself:**
- Pray for this leader by name before you sit down with them.
- Ask God to give you ears to hear what they're not saying.
- Review this guide, but don't script the conversation. Let it breathe.

**Set the stage:**
- Meet somewhere private and unhurried — not a lobby or a hallway.
- Block 60–75 minutes. Don't rush it.
- Ask them to bring their results (printed or on their phone) so they can reference them.
- You do not need to see their results. You are guiding the reflection, not grading the answers.

## How to Open the Conversation

Start with presence, not process. Don't jump straight to the assessment.

> *"Before we get into your results, I just want to check in. How are you doing — not ministry-wise, just you? What's been on your heart lately?"*

Give them 5–10 minutes here. What they bring up unprompted is often more revealing than any assessment answer.

Then transition:

> *"I'm grateful you took the time to do the Flow Assessment. These questions aren't easy — they require a lot of honesty. How did it feel going through it?"*

Listen for:
- Relief ("I finally feel like someone named what I've been carrying")
- Resistance ("I wasn't sure some of these applied to me")
- Surprise ("I didn't expect that one to show up so high")
- Defensiveness (note it gently, don't push)

## The Core Debrief Questions

Use these questions as your framework. You don't need to ask all of them — follow the thread that the Holy Spirit opens. Each section corresponds to a natural movement in the conversation.

---

### Part 1: Surface the Landscape

> *"What were your top two or three roadblocks — the ones that scored the highest for you?"*

Let them name it. Don't speculate or suggest.

> *"When you saw those come up high, was that surprising to you — or did some part of you already know?"*

> *"Which one felt the most uncomfortable to be honest about?"*

> *"Was there one that you almost rated lower than it deserved — and then you went back and changed it?"*

This last question is particularly powerful. It gets at what they were tempted to hide.

---

### Part 2: Connect the Story

The roadblocks are not random — they are rooted in lived experience. Help them make the connection between what they scored and where it came from.

> *"Let's take your highest roadblock for a moment. When did you first learn that fear? If you trace it back — what's the earliest memory or season that comes to mind?"*

> *"How has this shown up in your leadership before? Not hypothetically — can you think of a real moment where this roadblock cost you something?"*

> *"Has anyone in your life ever named this in you — a parent, a spouse, a mentor? What did they see?"*

Be patient here. Some people need silence before they can answer honestly.

---

### Part 3: Explore the Impact on Discipleship

This is the bridge from personal story to ministry fruit. The whole point of the Flow Assessment is that what blocks us internally blocks multiplication externally.

> *"Based on what you're seeing — how do you think this roadblock has shown up in how you lead others?"*

> *"Is there a disciple or potential disciple who might have been affected by this? Not to pile on guilt — just to see it clearly."*

> *"If this roadblock stayed at the same level for the next three years, what would that cost your group? What would multiplication look like?"*

> *"On the other hand — if God broke this open in you, what might become possible?"*

That last question is where hope lives. Don't skip it.

---

### Part 4: The Spiritual Root

The roadblocks are ultimately about what we believe about God. Help them get there.

> *"Underneath this fear — what do you think you're really believing about God? Not what you'd say in a sermon, but what your gut has been assuming?"*

> *"When you imagine handing this over to God — what do you feel? Relief? Skepticism? Something else?"*

> *"Where do you sense God has already been working on this? Are there places where you've already seen Him move in this area, even a little?"*

Don't rush to Scripture. Let them sit in the question first. If they find their way to a passage on their own, follow them there. If not, you can offer the one from their roadblock section as a closing anchor.

---

### Part 5: The Action Plan

The assessment ends with each person selecting 1–2 action steps and naming an accountability partner. Use this section to solidify that.

> *"What action steps did you choose for your top roadblock? Talk me through why those felt right."*

> *"What would make it hard to actually follow through on those? What are the likely obstacles?"*

> *"Who did you name as your accountability partner? Do they know yet?"*

> *"What's the specific question they should ask you — and when are you going to set that up?"*

If they haven't selected action steps yet, walk them through it now:

> *"Looking at your top roadblock — which of the action steps feels both uncomfortable enough to matter and realistic enough to actually do?"*

Help them pick one. Specific. Dated. Named accountability. That's the win.

---

### Part 6: Close with Prayer

Don't end with a to-do list. End with the Father.

Ask them what they want prayer for — not what you've noticed, what *they* are bringing.

> *"Before I pray, what do you want to tell God about what came up today? If you could say one thing to Him right now, what would it be?"*

Then pray over them — specifically, personally, with faith. Name what you see in them. Name what you believe God is doing. Speak to the roadblock with authority.

## Roadblock Reference: Key Themes Per Fear

Use this section to help you follow the thread of each roadblock if it comes up.

---

### Fear of Failure
**Theme:** Identity rooted in performance, not grace.
**Key probe:** *"What does failure mean about you — about who you are?"*
**Watch for:** Perfectionism dressed up as humility. Leaders who say "I'm not ready" indefinitely.
**Scripture anchor:** 2 Timothy 1:7

---

### Fear of Conflict
**Theme:** Love misunderstood as the absence of tension.
**Key probe:** *"When you avoid a hard conversation, who are you actually protecting — them or yourself?"*
**Watch for:** People-pleasing disguised as pastoral care. Leaders who let disciples drift because confrontation feels unkind.
**Scripture anchor:** Ephesians 4:15

---

### Fear of Discomfort
**Theme:** Margin collapse. Life too full for the slow work of relationship.
**Key probe:** *"What would you have to stop doing to make real room for discipleship?"*
**Watch for:** Busyness as identity. Leaders who are exhausted before they start.
**Scripture anchor:** Matthew 11:28–30

---

### Fear of Rejection
**Theme:** Shame beneath the surface. Performing instead of being known.
**Key probe:** *"What are you afraid would happen if the people in your group really knew you?"*
**Watch for:** Leaders who keep disciples at arm's length. Oversharing or undersharing as self-protection.
**Scripture anchor:** 1 John 4:18

---

### Fear of Loss of Control
**Theme:** Outcomes-ownership. Carrying what only God can carry.
**Key probe:** *"What are you afraid will happen if you release this person and they do it differently than you would?"*
**Watch for:** Micromanagers who never multiply because they can't trust others to lead. Co-leaders who feel stifled.
**Scripture anchor:** Proverbs 3:5–6

---

### Fear of Financial Hardship
**Theme:** Scarcity mindset. Provision trusted in self, not God.
**Key probe:** *"What's the story behind your relationship with money? Where did that script come from?"*
**Watch for:** Leaders who feel they need more resources before they can lead. Stinginess toward hospitality.
**Scripture anchor:** Philippians 4:19

---

### Fear of Change
**Theme:** Comfort with the familiar even when it's not life-giving.
**Key probe:** *"What exactly would you lose if this changed? Is that loss real, or is it a story?"*
**Watch for:** Loyalty to methods over mission. Leaders who prefer the security of the known over the call of God.
**Scripture anchor:** Isaiah 43:18–19

---

## Signs the Conversation Is Going Deep

You want to notice when you've moved from the surface to the real thing. These are signs you're there:

- They slow down. Pauses get longer.
- They reference something that happened a long time ago.
- They say "I've never told anyone this."
- They laugh nervously right before something important.
- They start a sentence and stop.
- They cry, or fight not to.

When these moments come — **stay**. Don't rush past them with the next question. Let the silence hold them. That's where God works.

---

## What This Conversation Is Not

- It is not a counseling session. If deep trauma surfaces, affirm them and refer appropriately.
- It is not a performance review. Their roadblocks do not determine whether they lead a DNA group.
- It is not your confession time. Stay curious about them, not illustrative about yourself.
- It is not a one-time fix. This is the beginning of a longer journey.

---

## After the Meeting

Within 24 hours:
- Send a short note affirming something specific you saw in them during the conversation.
- Confirm the action step they committed to and when you'll follow up.

At 30 days:
- Check in briefly: *"How is [specific action step] going? What are you learning?"*

At 90 days:
- Encourage them to retake the assessment and note what's shifted.
- Consider doing a second debrief if warranted.

---

## A Note on Privacy

The leader's results belong to them. You are not entitled to see their ratings, their reflection answers, or their written responses. The goal of this conversation is to help them hear from God about what He is already surfacing — not to audit their answers.

If a leader volunteers their scores or reads from their reflection answers, receive it gratefully. But do not ask for it, and never create an environment where sharing feels required to move forward.

Trust that God can work through good questions without you needing to see the data.
