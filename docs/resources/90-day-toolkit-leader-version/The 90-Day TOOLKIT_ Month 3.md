## **Week 9:** 

# **Breaking Strongholds**

## **Reveal, Renounce, Replace**

### **Purpose**

To help disciples identify and break free from lies, strongholds, and agreements with the enemy through Spirit-led deliverance.

### **Why This Matters**

You've spent 8 weeks building trust, learning tools, and experiencing God's faithfulness. Now it's time to go deeper. The Holy Spirit wants to expose what's been holding you back and replace it with His truth.

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

**Leaders:**

* Pray for Holy Spirit sensitivity and discernment  
* Create a safe, private environment (this will get vulnerable)  
* Prepare soft instrumental worship music  
* Have notebooks/paper ready for disciples to write  
* Be ready to provide individual ministry if needed

**Disciples:**

* Come with an open heart  
* Be ready for the Holy Spirit to reveal hidden things  
* Trust the process—freedom is coming

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening & Worship (10 minutes)**

* Create a safe, holy atmosphere  
* Invite the Holy Spirit to lead  
* "Tonight, we're not just learning—we're experiencing freedom."  
* Brief prayer: "Holy Spirit, we invite You to lead this time. Reveal what needs to be exposed. Break what needs to be broken. Replace lies with Your truth. We surrender to You."

### **2\. What is a stronghold? (15 minutes)**

*"For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."* **— 2 Corinthians 10:3-5**

A stronghold is a fortified place—a lie, belief, or pattern that has become entrenched in your mind and heart. It's a place where the enemy has built a fortress in your thinking, and it affects how you see God, yourself, and others.

**Examples of strongholds:**

* "God doesn't really love me."  
* "I'm not enough."  
* "I'll always struggle with this sin."  
* "I have to perform to be accepted."  
* "No one can be trusted."  
* Unforgiveness, bitterness, fear, shame, control, pride

**Where do strongholds come from?**

* Childhood wounds or trauma  
* Words spoken over you (by parents, authority figures, peers)  
* Repeated sin patterns that become agreements  
* Cultural lies or worldly philosophies  
* Demonic oppression or deception

**The goal tonight:**  
We're not going to pick an area for you to work on. The Holy Spirit knows exactly what needs to be addressed. We're going to ask Him to reveal it, and then we'll walk through freedom together.

This is Spirit-led deliverance. We're not the ones doing the work—God is. We're just facilitating an environment where you can hear Him clearly and respond in obedience.

### **3\. Introduce Reveal, Renounce, Replace (10 minutes)**

This is a three-step process of Spirit-led deliverance:

**STEP 1: REVEAL** – Ask God to show you the lie or stronghold

* "God, is there a lie I'm believing about You? About myself? About others?"  
* Wait and listen. He will bring something to mind.  
* It might be a thought, a memory, a feeling, or a word.  
* Don't filter it. Don't dismiss it as "not spiritual enough." Just receive it.

**STEP 2: RENOUNCE** – Verbally break agreement with the lie

* Acknowledge it needs to go  
* Confess it as sin (if applicable) or renounce it as a lie  
* Break any covenant, partnership, or agreement you've made with it  
* Pray for it to leave in Jesus' name  
* Forgive anyone who contributed to this lie (if needed)  
* **This must be verbal.** You have to say it out loud. Your voice has authority.

**STEP 3: REPLACE** – Ask God what He wants to give you instead

* "God, I give You this lie. What do You give me in return?"  
* Receive His truth, His identity, His promise  
* Declare it out loud  
* Write it down so you don't forget it

**Critical principle: We are never meant to be empty—we are meant to be FULL of the right things.**

If you only renounce the lie but don't replace it with truth, the enemy will try to fill that space again. Jesus said in Matthew 12:43-45 that when an unclean spirit leaves, it looks for a place to return. If it finds the house "empty," it brings seven more spirits with it.        **We don't just remove—we REPLACE.**

### **4\. Guided Reveal, Renounce, Replace Session (35 minutes)**

**Setup:**

* Dim the lights slightly  
* Play soft instrumental worship music  
* Everyone has space to spread out (not crowded)  
* Leaders have notebooks ready to take notes if needed  
* This is a time of ministry, not performance

---

### **REVEAL (10 minutes)**

**Leader guides the group:**

"Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Invite the Holy Spirit into this moment.

We're going to ask Him a simple question, and then we're going to wait for Him to answer.

Ask Him this: **'God, is there a lie I'm believing? Is there a stronghold in my life that You want to break tonight?'**

Don't force it. Don't pick something because it sounds good or because you think you should. Just wait. Listen. What's He bringing to your mind?

It might be:

* A belief about God (He's distant, He's disappointed in me, He doesn't care)  
* A belief about yourself (I'm worthless, I'm broken, I'm unlovable, I'm a failure)  
* A belief about others (No one can be trusted, everyone will leave me, I have to protect myself)  
* A memory that surfaced (something someone said to you, something that happened)  
* A sin pattern you can't shake (lust, anger, control, pride)  
* Unforgiveness toward someone (a parent, a friend, yourself, God)  
* A fear that controls you (fear of rejection, fear of failure, fear of intimacy)

Write it down. Be specific. Don't filter it—just receive what He's showing you.

If multiple things come to mind, ask God: 'Which one do You want to deal with tonight?' He'll show you."

*(Give them 10-15 minutes of silence. Leaders pray silently over the room. Play soft music. Watch for people who seem stuck or emotional—be ready to help privately.)*

**Check-in:**

"Has everyone received something? If you're still waiting, that's okay—keep listening. If you've received something, hold onto it. We're going to walk through this together."

*(If someone is really stuck, quietly offer to pray with them individually while the group continues.)*

### **RENOUNCE (10 minutes)**

**Leader guides:** "Now we're going to renounce what God revealed. This is where you verbally break agreement with the lie or stronghold.

I'm going to lead you through a prayer, and you're going to pray it out loud—either whisper it or speak it boldly. Insert the specific lie or stronghold God showed you.

Remember: **Your voice has authority.** The enemy must flee when you use the name of Jesus. Let's pray together:”

***"God, You've shown me that I've been believing the lie that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.***

***I confess this as sin. \[if applicable\] / I renounce this lie as a deception from the enemy. \[if it's not sin but false belief\]***

***I break agreement with this lie right now in Jesus' name.***

***I break any covenant I've made with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.***

***I break any partnership with the enemy over \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.***

***I forgive \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for contributing to this lie. \[if applicable—parent, friend, abuser, self, etc.\]***

***I release them from my judgment. I choose forgiveness.***

***I command this stronghold to leave me NOW in the name of Jesus.***

***I am covered by the blood of Christ. I belong to God. I am free.”***

**Leader after the prayer:**

"Take a moment. Breathe. How do you feel? Some of you may feel lighter already. Some of you may feel like you're in a battle right now. Both are normal.

If you need to cry, cry. If you need to sit in silence, do that. We're not rushing this."

*(Leaders watch for reactions—tears, relief, resistance. Be ready to pray over individuals if needed. Some may need a hand on their shoulder, some may need space.)*

### **REPLACE (10 minutes)**

**Leader guides:**

"You've renounced the lie. Now don't leave that space empty. This is the most important part.

Ask God: **'What do You want to give me instead? What is the TRUTH?'**

Listen. What is He saying? What truth is He speaking over you?

It might be:

* A Scripture that comes to mind  
* A word or phrase ('You are Mine.' 'You are loved.' 'You are free.')  
* A picture or image of how He sees you  
* A promise He's making to you

Write it down. This is your new identity. Your new reality. This is what you're going to stand on when the lie tries to come back."

*(Give them 10 minutes to listen and write. Play soft music. Pray over them.)*

**Declare the Truth:**

**Leader:**

"Now we're going to declare the truth out loud. One by one, I want you to share:

1. The lie you renounced  
2. The truth God is giving you to replace it

You don't have to share all the details if it's too personal—but declare the truth. Say it out loud. Let the group hear it. Let the enemy hear it. Let YOUR SOUL hear it.

We're going to affirm each other as we go."

*(Go around the circle. Each person shares briefly. Leaders affirm and may add a quick prayer of blessing over each person.)*

**Example:**

**Disciple:** "I renounced the lie that I'm not enough. God says I am fully loved, fully accepted, and fully equipped for everything He's called me to."

**Group response:** "Amen." / "Yes, Lord." / "We receive that."

**Leader (optional):** "God, we agree with what You've spoken over \[name\]. Seal this truth in their heart. Let them walk in this freedom. In Jesus' name."

*(Continue around the circle until everyone has shared.)*

### **5\. Unpack and Closing Prayer (15 minutes)**

**Leader prays over the group:**

"Father, thank You for what You've done tonight. You've exposed lies, broken strongholds, and replaced them with truth.

We seal this work by the blood of Jesus. We declare that what You've broken tonight stays broken. What You've spoken tonight stays spoken.

We ask You to fill every empty place with Your Spirit. Guard these hearts. Protect this freedom. Let this be permanent transformation, not just a moment.

If the enemy tries to bring that lie back, remind them of tonight. Remind them of Your truth. Give them the strength to renounce it again and again until it has no power.

We worship You for who You are—the Deliverer, the Redeemer, the One who sets captives free.

In Jesus' mighty name, Amen."

### **Commission:**

"You just experienced deliverance. This is what the Christian life is—continual freedom.

Don't let that lie creep back in. When it tries (and it will), do this:

1. **Recognize it:** 'That's the lie again.'  
2. **Renounce it:** 'I already broke agreement with that. It has no power over me.'  
3. **Replace it:** 'The truth is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.'

This isn't a one-time event. It's a lifestyle. You now have a tool you can use anytime the enemy tries to deceive you."

### **After the Meeting (Leader Follow-Up)**

**1\. Individual Check-Ins**

* Text each disciple within 24 hours: "How are you feeling after last night? How's your heart?"  
* If someone had a significant breakthrough (deep tears, major revelation), follow up personally with a call or coffee  
  **2\. Watch for Spiritual Warfare**

* The enemy will try to reclaim ground. Warn disciples in your follow-up text:  
  * "If that lie tries to come back this week, don't just ignore it—renounce it again out loud and declare the truth God gave you."

  **3\. Encourage Daily Reinforcement**

* "Journal the truth God gave you in your 3D Journal this week."  
* "Pray it over yourself during your 4D Prayer sessions."  
* "Write the truth on a notecard and put it somewhere you'll see it daily (mirror, car dashboard, phone lock screen)."  
  **4\. Celebrate Testimonies**

* In your group chat, ask: "How has the truth God spoke over you been changing things this week?"  
* Share testimonies of freedom at the start of next week's meeting

### **Coaching Tips for Leaders**

**If someone can't hear anything during REVEAL:**

* Don't force it. Quietly pray with them.  
* Ask gently: "What's been the hardest struggle for you lately? Let's ask God about that."  
* Sometimes people can't hear because they're afraid of what God will say. Reassure them: "God is kind. He's not going to shame you."

**If someone breaks down emotionally:**

* This is normal and healthy. The Holy Spirit is doing surgery.  
* Let them cry. Sit with them. Don't rush them.  
* Offer a tissue, a hand on the shoulder (if appropriate), or just silent presence.  
* Pray quietly over them: "God, meet them here. Bring healing. Bring freedom."

**If someone reveals something that requires deeper ministry (trauma, abuse, suicidal thoughts):**

* Don't try to fix it all tonight. This may be bigger than one session.  
* Pray "God, we break the power of this over \[name\] right now. Bring Your peace."  
* Afterward, privately offer to connect them with a counselor, pastor, or professional help.  
* Follow up within 24 hours.

**If the lie is connected to unforgiveness:**

* Stop and address forgiveness first before moving to renounce the lie.  
* "Do you need to forgive someone? Let's do that now before we break the lie."  
* Walk them through a simple forgiveness prayer: "God, I forgive \[name\] for \[what they did\]. I release them from my judgment. I choose to let this go."

**If someone's "truth" doesn't align with Scripture:**

* Gently correct: "I love what you're hearing, but let's make sure it lines up with Scripture. Can we find a verse that confirms that?"  
* Point them to God's Word as the ultimate authority on truth.

**If the group is hesitant or fearful:**

* Leaders go first. Model vulnerability.  
* Share your own Reveal, Renounce, Replace moment (either from tonight or a past experience).  
* "I'll go first so you can see what this looks like."

### **What to Watch For**

**Good Signs:**

* Tears, emotional release (Holy Spirit is moving)  
* Breakthrough moments ("I've never seen that before." / "That makes so much sense now.")  
* Boldness in declaring truth  
* Lightness/freedom after the session ("I feel like a weight lifted.")  
* Disciples encouraging each other

**Red Flags:**

* Complete resistance to the process (may indicate deeper spiritual bondage or unwillingness to surrender)  
* Inability to receive truth even after renouncing lie (may need more time, more ministry, or deliverance from demonic influence)  
* Shame or condemnation after sharing (address immediately: "There is no condemnation in Christ. You are loved. You are safe here.")  
* Someone trying to minimize or joke through the process (may be a defense mechanism—gently call it out)

## **Week 10:** 

# **Identity Shift**

### **Who You Are in Christ**

### **Purpose**

To help disciples shift from their own limited perception of themselves to embrace who God says they are, and to equip them with an Identity Battle Plan for ongoing spiritual warfare.

### **Why This Matters**

You've broken strongholds in Week 9\. Now it's time to build up the truth. The enemy doesn't just attack with lies—he attacks your identity. When you know who you are in Christ and have Scripture to back it up, you can stand firm when the enemy comes. This isn't just a nice teaching—this is warfare training.

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

**Leaders:**

* Pray for Holy Spirit to reveal true identity over each disciple  
* Print Identity Battle Plan worksheets (one per disciple)  
* Have Bibles ready for Scripture searching  
* Prepare to share your own identity journey  
* Review the diagram teaching (Independent/Insecure/Arrogant/Humility axes)

**Disciples:**

* Come ready to see yourself the way God sees you  
* Bring your Bible and a pen  
* Be prepared to hear truth that might challenge your self-perception

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening: The Identity Transfer (8 minutes)**

**Leader opens:**

"Tonight we're talking about identity. Here's the truth: Christ has already transferred His identity to you. The moment you became a Christian, you received a new identity. You are no longer who you were. You are who He says you are.

But here's the problem: just because Christ has given us this new identity doesn't mean we automatically experience it. We have to come into agreement with it. We have to believe it. We have to fight for it.

Tonight, we're going to discover the gap between how you see yourself and how God sees you. And we're going to close that gap."

**Opening Prayer:**

"God, open our eyes to see ourselves the way You see us. Expose the lies we've believed about ourselves. Reveal the truth. Give us the courage to deny our own opinions and come into agreement with Yours. In Jesus' name."

### **2\. The Mirror Test: How Do You See Yourself? (7 minutes)**

**Leader guides:**

"Let's start with an honest assessment. I want you to answer this question—not the 'Christian' answer, but the real answer:

**When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? What kind of person are you? What do you observe about yourself and your character?**

Take 4-5 minutes and write it down. Be honest. This is between you and God."

**Don’t say a word.** Move on to the next section. We will work through these after completing the next question.

### 

### **3\. Listening Prayer: How Does God See You? (10 minutes)**

"Now we're going to practice the listening prayer skills you learned in Week 6\. But this time, you're not listening for someone else—you're listening for yourself.

Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Invite the Holy Spirit into this moment.

Ask God this question: **'God, when You look at me, what do You see?'**

Don't force it. Don't make something up. Just wait. Listen. What is He saying?

**You might hear:**

* A word or phrase ('beloved,' 'strong,' 'chosen,' 'warrior')  
* A picture or image  
* A Scripture that comes to mind  
* A feeling of His affection or pride over you  
  Write down everything you hear. Don't filter it. Don't dismiss it as 'not spiritual enough.' Just receive it."

*(Give them 7 minutes of silence. Play soft instrumental worship music. Leaders pray silently over the room. Watch for people who seem stuck—be ready to help privately.)*

**Check-in:**

"Has everyone received something? If you're still waiting, that's okay—keep listening. If you've received something, hold onto it. We're going to explore this."

### **4\. The Identity Gap: Comparing the Two (10 minutes)**

"Now look at what you wrote. What do you notice about the way you see yourself and the way that God sees you? Why is there a difference? Why is there an identity gap?

Here's the truth: **One of you must be wrong. One of you must be incorrect.** And we all know that God is not incorrect. His perspective is the true perspective. Your perception of yourself is distorted by lies, wounds, shame, and the enemy's accusations.

**We all need an identity shift.** Not one of us has a perfect perspective. So we must deny our own opinion of ourselves and come into agreement with His.

**Who He says I am is who I truly am.**"

### **5\. Teaching: The Gideon Encounter (15 minutes)**

**Leader teaches:**

"Let me show you what an identity shift looks like in the Bible.

**Read Judges 6:11-16** (or summarize):

God meets Gideon in a winepress. Gideon is hiding from the Midianites, trying to thresh wheat in a place where you crush grapes. This guy is scared, doing the best he can under terrible circumstances.

And God shows up and says: **'The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor\!'**

But Gideon doesn't receive it. He reminds God that He's got the wrong guy:

*'O my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.'*

Gideon knew God was mighty. He believed the stories of God's faithfulness. But his personal perception of himself was completely based on earthly standards—his family's status, his position, his résumé.

**God calls him a 'mighty man of valor' while he's hiding in fear.**

And notice: God doesn't correct him. God doesn't argue with him. God just says, **'I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites.'**

Sometimes who Jesus says we are is so far off from our personal perception, we need sign after sign to actually grab hold of it by faith.

And God is willing to meet us there. He's not afraid of our unbelief. He's not intimidated by our small thinking. He uses us in our weakness to glorify His name.

**Here's the question:**

When God speaks over you—when He calls you something you don't feel like you are—will you come into agreement with what He says? Or will you try to talk yourself out of the identity He has given you?

**This is false humility.**

**False humility is exalting your opinion of you over what God says about you.**

It's not humble to say 'I'm nothing' when God says 'You are My beloved son, My beloved daughter, a mighty warrior, a chosen vessel.'

True humility is agreeing with God—even when it feels too good to be true."

**Pause for emphasis:**

"So let me ask you again: **When God looks at you, what does He see?**

Whatever He just spoke to you—that's the truth. Not how you feel. Not your track record. Not your failures. **His word over you is the truth.**"

**Declare together:**

"Everyone say this out loud with me: **'I am who Jesus says I am.'**"

*(Lead them in declaring it 2-3 times with increasing boldness.)*

### **6\. Teaching: Do You Agree? (15 minutes)**

"As a follower of Jesus, we have one job: **To say 'Amen.'**

Amen \= I agree.

**Read 2 Corinthians 1:18-20:**

*'But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No." For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silas and Timothy—was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes." For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.'*

God's promises are 'Yes' in Christ. Our job is to say **'Amen'**—to agree with what He says.

#### **Two statements we need to come into agreement with.**

1. **Who God says He is** (God Dependent)  
2. **Who God says I am** (God Confident)

If I come into agreement with these two statements, I will function in the likeness of Christ. That is my identity. And that is your identity.”

---

**\[Draw the “Identity Diagram” on a whiteboard or have it printed on paper beforehand. This resource is provided in your DNA Group Dashboard.\]**

"We have this cross. At the center is **Christ**—true humility and complete God dependence.

**Horizontal axis (left to right):**

* Left \= **Insecure** (I think too little of myself)  
* Right \= **Arrogant** (I think too much of myself)

**Vertical axis (top to bottom):**

* Top \= **Independent** (I don't need God or others)  
* Bottom \= **Co-dependent** (I rely on one person to validate me or make me feel worthy)

**At the center of the cross is Christ:**

* **True Humility** – I agree with who God says I am  
* **God Dependent** – I agree with who God says He is

Christ is not arrogant. He's not insecure. He's not independent. He's not codependent.

He is **God Dependent** and He walks in **True Humility.**

**God Dependent** means that He depends on the community of God as the Trinity **and His body**—because you cannot separate the body from the head. We are all together in this.

This is **not codependency**, where you rely on one person to make you feel a certain way or to validate you. That's unhealthy.

**God dependence** means I depend on God and I depend on the body of Christ as God's design for community and strength.

**So how do I function in true humility and God dependence?**

**To function in true humility:** I must agree with who God says I am.

**To function in God dependence:** I must agree with who God says He is.

**If I come into agreement with these two statements, I will function in the likeness of Christ.**"

### **Discussion Question:**

"Where do you tend to fall on this diagram?

* Do you struggle with insecurity? (thinking too little of yourself)  
* Do you struggle with arrogance? (thinking you don't need God's help)  
* Do you struggle with independence? (trying to do it all on your own)  
* Do you struggle with codependency? (needing one person's approval to feel okay)

Jesus is calling you to the center—to true humility and God dependence."

### **7\. Identity Battle Plan Launch (15 minutes)**

**Leader teaches:**

"Okay, here's where this gets practical. Now we're going to create a tool that you can use for the rest of your life. It's called your **Identity Battle Plan.**

When the enemy attacks your identity—and he will—you need to be ready to fight back. Not with your feelings. Not with your willpower. But with **Scripture.**

The Identity Battle Plan has two columns:

**Column 1: Who I Am** (with Scripture to back it up) **Column 2: Who He Is** (the corresponding attribute of God)

For example:

* **Who I am:** 'More than conquerors' — Romans 8:37  
* **Who He is:** 'Gracious giver' — Romans 8:32

When the enemy whispers 'You're a failure,' you pull out your Identity Battle Plan and say: **'No. I am more than a conqueror through Christ who loves me. God is a gracious giver who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for me. How will He not also freely give me all things?'**

You're not just fighting with positive thinking. You're fighting with **the Word of God.**

This is your weapon. This is how you refresh your agreement with who God says you are."

### **Activity: Start Your Identity Battle Plan (15 minutes)**

**Leader guides:**

"I'm handing out the Identity Battle Plan worksheet. It has two columns and blank lines.

Here's what we're going to do for the next 15 minutes:

1. **Ask God:** 'Who am I to You?' Write down what He says.  
2. **Search Scripture:** Use your Bible or ask someone in the group to help you find a verse that backs up that identity.  
3. **Find the corresponding attribute of God:** Who does God have to be for you to be that?

For example:

* If God says 'You are forgiven,' then God must be 'Merciful and full of grace.'  
* If God says 'You are strong,' then God must be 'My strength and my shield.'

Your goal tonight is to fill in **at least 3-5 lines.** But this is a lifelong tool. You'll keep adding to this. You'll keep finding more Scriptures. You'll keep discovering who you are in Christ.

**Important:**

You will not be graded on this. This Battle Plan is for **you.** This is so when the enemy comes and attacks your identity, you have something to fight back with.

Let me be very clear: **It's not IF the enemy attacks you. It's WHEN.**

He will attack your identity. He will whisper lies. He will try to get you to come into agreement with shame, fear, inadequacy, and condemnation.

You must be prepared to fight back with Scripture. You must be prepared to declare your identity and refresh your agreement with who God says you are.

Let's get started. If you need help finding Scripture, ask. If you're stuck, ask God to speak. Leaders, we're going to walk around and help."

*(Give them 15 minutes. Play soft music. Leaders circulate and help. Encourage them. Affirm what they're writing. Pray over them as they work.)*

### **8\. Declarations & Closing (10 minutes)**

**Leader invites:**

"We're going to close by declaring what God has spoken.

One by one, I want you to share:

1. One 'Who I am' statement from your Battle Plan  
2. The Scripture that backs it up

Just one. Make it bold. Declare it out loud. Let the group hear it. Let the enemy hear it. Let YOUR SOUL hear it."

*(Go around the circle. Each person declares one identity statement.)*

**Example:**

**Disciple:** "I am beloved. Colossians 3:12 says I am God's chosen, holy, and dearly loved."

**Group response:** "Amen." / "Yes, Lord." / "We receive that."

*(Continue around the circle until everyone has shared.)*

**Leader closes with prayer:**

"Father, thank You for what You've done tonight. You've opened our eyes to see ourselves the way You see us. You've given us weapons to fight back when the enemy attacks.

We seal this truth by the blood of Jesus. We declare that we are who You say we are. Not who we feel like. Not who our past says. Not who the enemy accuses us of being.

We are Yours. We are loved. We are chosen. We are strong in You.

Guard these truths in our hearts. When the lies come back—and they will—remind us of tonight. Remind us of Your Word. Give us the courage to stand firm in our identity.

In Jesus' mighty name, Amen."

---

### **Commission:**

"You just created a weapon. Your Identity Battle Plan is not a one-time exercise. It's a lifelong tool.

**Here's your assignment:**

1. **Keep adding to it.** Every time God speaks a new truth over you, write it down with Scripture.  
2. **Use it when the enemy attacks.** When lies come, pull out your Battle Plan and declare the truth out loud.  
3. **Refresh your agreement daily.** Read through your Battle Plan during your 3D or 4D time. Remind yourself who you are.

This isn't IF the enemy attacks. It's WHEN.

**Be ready.**"

## **Between Meetings (Leader Follow-Up)**

### **1\. Individual Check-Ins**

* Text each disciple within 24 hours: "How are you doing after last night? What's one truth God spoke over you that's sticking with you?"  
* Encourage them to add to their Identity Battle Plan throughout the week

### **2\. Encourage Daily Reinforcement**

* "Read through your Identity Battle Plan every morning this week."  
* "Journal about one 'Who I am' statement in your 3D Journal."  
* "Pray one identity statement over yourself during your 4D Prayer time."  
* "Write one identity truth on a notecard and put it somewhere you'll see it daily (mirror, car dashboard, phone lock screen)."

### **3\. Watch for Spiritual Warfare**

* The enemy will attack identity this week. Warn disciples in your follow-up:  
  * "If lies start coming back this week, don't just ignore them—renounce them out loud and declare the truth from your Identity Battle Plan."

### **4\. Celebrate Testimonies**

* In your group chat, ask: "What's one way this week that knowing your identity in Christ changed how you responded to something?"  
* Share testimonies of identity breakthroughs at the start of next week's meeting

## 

## **Coaching Tips for Leaders**

### **If someone can't hear God during listening prayer:**

* Don't force it. Quietly pray with them.  
* Ask gently: "What's something you've always wished God would say about you? Ask Him if that's true."  
* Sometimes people can't hear because they're afraid of what God will say. Reassure them: "God is kind. He's not going to shame you."

### **If someone struggles to find Scripture:**

* Help them search. Use a Bible concordance or a phone app.  
* Suggest starting with Romans 8, Ephesians 1-2, 1 Peter 2, or Colossians 3\.  
* If they're stuck, give them one to start: "You are loved—1 John 3:1."

### **If someone writes an identity that doesn't align with Scripture:**

* Gently correct: "I love what you're hearing, but let's make sure it lines up with Scripture. Can we find a verse that confirms that?"  
* Point them to God's Word as the ultimate authority on identity.

### **If someone is emotional:**

* This is normal and healthy. Identity is deeply personal.  
* Let them cry. Sit with them. Offer a tissue, a hand on the shoulder (if appropriate), or just silent presence.  
* Pray quietly: "God, meet them here. Seal this truth in their heart."

### **If the group is hesitant or surface-level:**

* Leaders go first. Model vulnerability.  
* Share your own identity struggle and what God has spoken over you.  
* "I'll go first so you can see what this looks like."

### 

### **Good Signs:**

* Tears, emotional release (Holy Spirit is moving)  
* Breakthrough moments ("I've never seen myself that way before." / "That's exactly what I needed to hear.")  
* Boldness in declaring identity  
* Lightness/freedom after the session ("I feel different.")  
* Disciples writing passionately on their Battle Plans

### **Red Flags:**

* Complete resistance to the process (may indicate deeper wounds or lies)  
* Inability to receive truth even after God speaks (may need more time or ministry)  
* Shame or self-condemnation after hearing God's voice (address immediately: "There is no condemnation in Christ. You are loved. You are safe here.")  
* Someone trying to minimize or joke through the process (may be a defense mechanism—gently call it out)

### **Key Takeaways**

**For Disciples:**

* Christ has given you a new identity, but you must come into agreement with it  
* False humility is exalting your opinion over God's opinion  
* True humility \= agreeing with who God says you are  
* God dependence \= agreeing with who God says He is  
* Your Identity Battle Plan is a weapon for ongoing spiritual warfare  
* It's not IF the enemy attacks your identity—it's WHEN. Be ready.

**For Leaders:**

* This week builds on Week 9 (Strongholds). You've torn down lies—now you're building up truth.  
* Identity is deeply personal. Create space for vulnerability and emotion.  
* The Identity Battle Plan is a lifelong tool. Encourage disciples to keep adding to it.  
* Watch for identity attacks this week. Follow up and remind disciples to use their Battle Plan.

## **Week 11:**

# **Spiritual Gifts**

## **Discover Your Design to Serve**

### **Purpose**

To help disciples discover how God has uniquely designed them to serve the Body of Christ through spiritual gifts, while ensuring their identity remains rooted in Christ—not in their function.

### **Why This Matters**

You've broken strongholds (Week 9\) and established your identity in Christ (Week 10). Now it's time to discover HOW God wants to express His love through you. Spiritual gifts aren't about what makes you special—they're about how the Father equips you to serve others for the "common good" of the Body. This week, you'll discover your design and activate your gifts through impartation.

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

**Leaders:**

* **SEND THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS ASSESSMENT** to all disciples at least 3-4 days before the meeting (via DNA Group Dashboard)  
* Review each disciple's assessment results before the meeting  
* Pray over each person's top gifts and ask God how to activate them  
* Print "The Hand of Christ" diagram if referencing five-fold ministry  
* Be prepared to lay hands on disciples for impartation  
* Create space for activation exercises (may need extra time)

**Disciples:**

* **COMPLETE THE SPIRITUAL GIFTS ASSESSMENT** before the meeting (link sent by your leader)  
* Bring your assessment results (printed or on your phone)  
* Come with an open heart to receive from the Father  
* Be ready to activate your gifts during the session

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening: The Father of Lights (10 minutes)**

**Leader opens:**

"Tonight we're talking about spiritual gifts. But before we dive into what gifts you have, we need to establish something critical: **These gifts don't define you. They don't make you more loved. They don't determine your value.**

You are beloved FIRST. Gifted SECOND.

***James 1:17*** **says:** *'Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.'*

**God is the best Dad you've always wanted and never knew you had.** And tonight, as beloved children, we're going to discover what gifts He's placed inside you—not for you, but for others. Not to puff you up, but to build up the Body.

Your gifts are for the **'common good.'** Everything God gives you is meant to be enjoyed by others."

**Opening Prayer:**

"Father, Thank You for being the Father of lights who gives good gifts. Tonight, help us receive what You've designed us to carry—not as orphans begging for validation, but as beloved children who boldly ask because we know who You are.

Show us how You've wired us. Unlock the gifts You've placed inside us. And help us use them to serve others, not ourselves. In Jesus' name."

### **2\. Identity First: Gifts Don't Define You (10 minutes)**

**Leader teaches:**

"Let's get something straight before we talk about your assessment results. **Your spiritual gifts are NOT your identity.** You are not:

* 'The prophetic one'  
* 'The teacher'  
* 'The mercy person'

You are a **beloved child of God** who happens to serve others through specific gifts.

**When we make our gifts our identity, here's what happens:**

1. **Pride** – 'I'm more valuable because I have this gift'  
2. **Comparison** – 'My gift is better/worse than theirs'  
3. **Insecurity** – 'If I don't perform well, I'm worthless'  
4. **Burnout** – 'I have to use this gift constantly to prove myself'

That's why we spent Week 10 establishing **who you are in Christ.** Your identity is secure. Your value is settled. Your acceptance is permanent. Now we can talk about gifts—because they flow FROM your identity, not TO your identity.

*'Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.' \-* **1 Corinthians 12:4-7**

**Notice three things:**

1. **Variety** – We all have different gifts (and that's by design)  
2. **Same Source** – Same Spirit, same Lord, same God (no gift is superior)  
3. **Common Good** – Your gifts are for OTHERS, not for you

**Key safeguard statement:**

Your spiritual gifts reveal HOW you'll serve, not WHO you are. You are loved the same whether you score high in prophecy or administration, healing or hospitality.

### **Discussion Questions:**

Before taking the assessment, what did you think 'spiritual gifts' meant?

Did you think some gifts were more valuable than others?

### 

### **3\. Review Your Assessment Results (15 minutes)**

**The assessment measured three categories:**

**TIER 1: HOW YOU SERVE** (Everyone has these)

* Romans 12 gifts: Teaching, serving, encouraging, giving, leading, mercy, prophecy  
* These are your natural wiring—how God designed you to love people  
  **TIER 2: SUPERNATURAL EMPOWERMENT** (Gifts you grow into)  
* 1 Corinthians 12 gifts: Wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discernment, tongues, interpretation  
* These are accessed through the Holy Spirit and activated through practice  
* You might have high DESIRE but low EXPERIENCE—and that's perfect  
  **TIER 3: LEADERSHIP CALLING** (Some, not all)  
* Ephesians 4 five-fold: Apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, teacher  
* Some people won't score high here—and that's God's perfect design  
* The Body needs more servants than it needs leaders

**Share your results**

1. Share your top 2-3 gifts from Tier 1 (How You Serve)  
2. Share 1-2 gifts from Tier 2 (Supernatural) that you DESIRE most  
3. Your partner's job: 'I can totally see that in you because...'

This isn't just about the quiz—it's about confirmation. You're affirming what you've already observed in each other over the last 10 weeks."

### **4\. One Body, Many Parts (10 minutes)**

Now let's talk about why we need ALL the gifts represented here tonight.

*Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ... If they were all one part, where would the body be? As it is, there are many parts, but one body. \-* **1 Corinthians 12:12-20**

Paul is saying: **You are necessary.** Without you, the Body is incomplete.

But here's the tension: We live in a culture that elevates certain gifts and ignores others.

* We celebrate the **teachers and preachers** (the public gifts)  
* We overlook the **servants and mercy-givers** (the behind-the-scenes gifts)

But God doesn't operate that way. In His economy:

* The gift of **serving** is just as valuable as the gift of **prophecy**  
* The gift of **mercy** is just as needed as the gift of **teaching**  
* The gift of **administration** is just as important as the gift of **miracles**

**We must learn to use our spiritual gifts so the Body can function effectively.**

**Verse 25-27:** *'...so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.'*

We are interconnected. When one person operates in their gift, we all benefit. When one person withholds their gift, we all suffer. It all comes down to these three words… **Play your part.**

### **5\. Teaching: Understanding the Gifts (15 minutes)**

Let me give you a quick overview of the gifts so you understand what you scored.

**TIER 1: HOW YOU SERVE (Romans 12:6-8)**

1. **Prophecy** – Hearing God's word and speaking truth (forthtelling, not just foretelling)  
2. **Serving** – Meeting practical needs; you see what needs to be done and do it  
3. **Teaching** – Taking complex truths and making them clear and applicable  
4. **Encouraging** – Speaking life, hope, and strength into others  
5. **Giving** – Generous with resources (time, money, skills); you see needs and meet them sacrificially  
6. **Leadership** – Organizing people and resources toward a vision; you naturally take initiative  
7. **Mercy** – Compassion in action; you feel others' pain and bring comfort

**TIER 2: SUPERNATURAL EMPOWERMENT (1 Corinthians 12:7-11)**

1. **Word of Wisdom** – Knowing God's will and how to implement it  
2. **Word of Knowledge** – Inside information about a person, place, or situation  
3. **Faith** – Believing God for impossible situations  
4. **Gifts of Healing** – Laying hands on the sick and seeing recovery  
5. **Miracles** – Performing signs that create awe in witnesses  
6. **Prophecy** – Hearing, seeing, and speaking God's rhema (now word)  
7. **Discerning of Spirits** – Knowing what spirit is at work (Holy Spirit, human spirit, demonic)  
8. **Tongues** – Speaking in unknown languages (earthly and heavenly)  
9. **Interpretation of Tongues** – Hearing an unknown language and interpreting it

**TIER 3: LEADERSHIP CALLING (Ephesians 4:11)**

These are leadership offices in the Body, not everyone will score high here:

1. **Apostle** – Sent ones who build kingdom culture; they make earth look like heaven  
2. **Prophet** – See and hear from heaven; they point the way and bring correction  
3. **Evangelist** – Reach the lost; they extend past the four walls  
4. **Shepherd/Pastor** – Care for the flock; married to the people  
5. **Teacher** – Open the Scriptures and equip the saints

### **Character \> Gifts:**

These gifts can grow and change over time. You can operate in gifts that aren't your 'top scores' when needed.The fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience) matters more than spiritual gifts without character.

### **6\. Impartation & Activation (20 minutes)**

Alright, we're not just going to LEARN about gifts tonight—we're going to ACTIVATE them.

*For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. \-* **2 Timothy 1:6-7**

Paul is saying: The gift is already in you. It just needs to be unlocked and fanned into flame.

Tonight, we're going to lay hands on you and pray for the gifts God has placed inside you. Then you're going to activate them IMMEDIATELY.

We don't open a gift from God and say 'I'll play with that later.' It's time to play your part in the Body.

**The Process:**

1. **ACCESS** – Submit to the Holy Spirit  
2. **ASK** – Ask boldly as beloved children (remember: you're not an orphan)  
3. **ACTIVATE** – Use the gift immediately (don't wait)

**ACTIVATION FORMAT:**

* As the group lays hands on each person, the leader prays specifically for their top 2 gifts  
* Immediately after prayer, that person uses the gift  or plans to use the gift if preparation is needed (see exercises below)

### **ACTIVATION IDEAS YOU CAN USE**

**TIER 1: SERVING GIFTS**

**1\. Teaching**

* Give 2 minutes to explain one truth from Scripture you learned in the last 10 weeks

* Text an encouragement to someone outside this group tonight

**4\. Giving**

* What resource (time, money, skill, possession) could you share with someone in need this week?

* Take ownership of organizing one aspect of next week's gathering

**6\. Mercy**

* Practice listening to someone without trying to fix—just presence and compassion

**7\. Prophecy (Romans 12 version)**

* Ask God for specific direction for someone's decision or situation  
* Practice: "I sense God is showing me..." about a situation someone shares

**2\. Word of Knowledge**

* Ask God to reveal something you couldn't naturally know about someone  
* Practice: "I'm seeing/sensing..." (could be a picture, word, feeling)

**3\. Faith**

* What impossible situation needs breakthrough? Declare faith over it  
* Practice believing God for something specific and bold right now

**4\. Gifts of Healing**

* Lay hands on someone with physical pain or sickness  
* Practice: "In Jesus' name, be healed"  
* Follow up: "What are you feeling/experiencing?"

**5\. Miracles**

* Pray for breakthrough in an impossible situation  
* Practice declaring the impossible possible

**6\. Prophecy (1 Cor 12 version)**

* Ask God what He's saying to someone right now (a "now word")  
* Practice: "I sense God is saying to you..."

**7\. Discerning of Spirits**

* What spirit is at work in a situation? (Holy Spirit, human spirit, demonic)  
* Practice: "I sense this is..." and test it with the group

**8\. Tongues**

* Ask the Holy Spirit for your prayer language  
* Practice: Open your mouth and let the Spirit give you words  
* If you already have it: Use it to pray over someone

**9\. Interpretation of Tongues**

* If someone prays in tongues, ask God what He's saying  
* Practice: "I sense that means..."

**IMPORTANT NOTES FOR LEADERS:**

* Don't force anyone to activate a gift they're uncomfortable with  
* Create a safe environment—no performance pressure  
* Affirm every attempt, even if it feels "small"  
* Remind them: We're learning. This is practice. Grace abounds.  
* Some gifts (healing, miracles) may not show immediate results—that's okay, we're stepping out in faith

---

### **7\. Debrief & Closing (15 minutes)**

**Leader guides:**

"Let's take a moment to process what just happened.

**Debrief Questions:**

* What did you experience when you activated your gift?  
* What felt natural? What felt stretching?  
* Did anyone see or experience breakthrough? (healing, prophecy, encouragement, etc.)

Remember: Activation is just the beginning. Now you need to **practice.**

Just like any skill, spiritual gifts grow stronger with use. Don't put this gift on a shelf. Use it this week."

**Challenge for the Week:**

"This week, I'm challenging you to use your top gift to serve someone outside this group.

* If you have **mercy**, reach out to someone who's suffering  
* If you have **encouragement**, send a text that speaks life  
* If you have **teaching**, explain a biblical truth to someone  
* If you have **prophecy**, ask God what He's saying to someone and share it  
* If you have **serving**, meet a practical need without being asked

Pay attention to where you see fruit—that's confirmation."

**Closing Prayer:**

"Father, Thank You for what You've done tonight. You've revealed how You've designed each of us to serve. You've unlocked gifts that have been dormant. You've activated what's been waiting.

We seal this by the blood of Jesus. We declare that we are vessels of Your power—not for our glory, but for the 'common good' of the Body.

Help us steward these gifts well. Help us use them in love. Help us serve others the way You've served us.

Remind us: We are beloved first, gifted second. Our identity is in You, not in our function.

We worship You as the Father of lights, the giver of every good and perfect gift. In Jesus' name, Amen."

## 

## **Leader Notes & Tips**

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**

1. **Don't let anyone make their gift their identity** – Constantly redirect to Christ  
2. **Don't compare gifts** – All are equally valuable in God's economy  
3. **Don't force activation** – Create space, but don't pressure  
4. **Don't skip the impartation** – Laying on of hands is biblical and powerful

**What to Watch For:**

* Disciples who are hesitant to activate (fear of failure, fear of looking foolish)  
* Disciples who over-spiritualize and miss the practical (administration, serving, helps)  
* Disciples who want to skip to "big" gifts without character development

**Red Flags:**

* Someone claims to have ALL the gifts (pride or misunderstanding)  
* Someone dismisses their gifts as "not important" (insecurity or false humility)  
* Someone uses their gift to control or manipulate others (spiritual abuse)

# **Week 12**

# **Life Assessment Revisited**

## **Measuring Growth & Setting New Goals**

### **Purpose**

To measure growth over the last 12 weeks, celebrate progress, identify areas still needing work, and set goals for continued growth.

### **Why This Matters**

Growth is gradual, and we often don't notice it unless we pause to look back. This week creates space to see how far they've come and vision for where they're going.

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

1. **Send Assessment Links**

   * Send the Week 12 Life Assessment link to each disciple

   * You can send this 1-2 days before OR right as the meeting starts

   * **Important:** Disciples will complete this LIVE during the meeting, just like Week 1

2. **Download Week 1/Week 12 Comparison PDFs**

   * The dashboard will auto-generate a comparison PDF for each disciple

   * Download these PDFs before the meeting OR pull them up live during discussion

     * Side-by-side scores for all 7 categories (Week 1 vs Week 12\)

     * Percentage change in each category

     * Specific questions where growth was most significant

     * Open-ended responses from both assessments

**What You'll Need:**

* Wifi access for disciples to complete online assessment  
* Access to comparison PDFs (digital or printed)

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening Worship & Reflection (10 minutes)**

* Worship and thank God for the last 8 weeks  
* Invite Holy Spirit to reveal growth and areas for continued work

### **2\. Retake Life Assessment (20 \- 30 minutes)**

**Send the Link:**

* Send the Week 12 Life Assessment link from your DNA Groups Dashboard  
* Have disciples check their email/text and click the link  
* They'll complete the same 42 questions they answered in Week 1

**While They Complete:**

* Pray for each disciple as they reflect on their journey  
* Monitor your dashboard to see when everyone has submitted  
* Once all assessments are submitted, the dashboard will auto-generate comparison PDFs

**Download Comparison PDFs:**

* As disciples submit, you can access the Week 1 vs Week 12 comparison PDF  
* Pull them up on your device during discussion (Optional: print them later)

### **3\. Comparison & Discussion (40 minutes)**

**For each person (10 minutes each):** Explain the Comparison Report

"Alright, the dashboard has now generated a comparison report for each of you. This report shows:

* Your scores in all 7 categories from Week 1 and Week 12  
* The percentage change in each category  
* Specific questions where you saw the biggest growth  
* Your open-ended responses from both weeks, side by side

I'm going to give each of you a copy (or show you on the screen). Take a few minutes to review it quietly, then we'll talk about what you see."

**Silent Reflection (5 minutes):**

* Hand out printed PDFs or have disciples view them on their phones via dashboard  
* Let them read silently  
* Watch for reactions—some will smile, some will tear up, some will look surprised

### **4\. Group Celebration & Vision Casting (10 minutes)**

**Celebrate together:**

* "What growth have you seen in each other?"  
* Go around and affirm one another  
* Leaders share what they've seen in each disciple

**Vision casting:**

* "These 12 weeks were just the beginning."  
* "You've laid a foundation. Now we build on it."  
* "Our goal is for you to multiply—to do this with someone else."

### **How to Celebrate Growth**

**Be specific:**

* Don't just say, "You've grown."  
* Say, "Week 1 you said you couldn't hear God's voice. Last week you gave a prophetic word that brought someone to tears. That's growth."

**Tell them what you've seen:**

* "I've watched you become more vulnerable."  
* "I've seen you take initiative in prayer."  
* "You used to be terrified of evangelism—now you're asking when we can go out again."

**Let the group affirm each other:**

* "What growth have you seen in \[person\]?"  
* Let them speak life over one another

**How to Address Stagnation**

**Be honest but kind:**

* "I notice you're still struggling with the same fear you named in Week 1\. Can we talk about that?"  
* "Your answers are almost identical to Week 1\. What do you think is keeping you stuck?"

**Ask questions:**

* "What's holding you back?"  
* "What do you need from us?"  
* "Are you willing to do what it takes to change?"

**Don't shame:**

* "Growth isn't linear. Some areas take longer."  
* "The fact that you're still here means you're committed. Let's figure out what needs to shift."

**Create a plan:**

* "What's one specific thing you'll do this month to address this?"  
* "How can we help you?"

### **Setting Goals for the Next Season**

**Ask each person:**

1. What's one area you want to focus on in the next 3 months?  
2. What does success look like in that area?  
3. What's one action step you'll take this week?  
4. How can we support you?

**Write them down** and revisit them in 3 months.

### 

### **Closing Prayer & Commissioning (10 minutes)**

**Pray over each person:**

* Thank God for their growth  
* Pray for continued transformation  
* Speak vision over them: "You're becoming a disciple-maker."

**Commission them:**

* "You've completed the 8-week toolkit. Now the real work begins."  
* "This isn't the end—it's the beginning of a lifestyle."  
* "We're not done with you. We're just getting started."  
  ---

### **What to Watch For**

**Good Signs:**

* Clear, measurable growth in multiple areas  
* Excitement about what God is doing  
* Desire to continue and go deeper  
* Ownership of their growth (not passive)

**Red Flags:**

* No growth at all (they may not be engaged)  
* Growth only in knowledge, not in character or action  
* Still stuck in the same sin or fear (may need deeper ministry)  
* Apathy or disengagement

### **Leader Debrief (After the Meeting)**

* **Save Comparison PDFs**

  * Keep a digital copy of each disciple's Week 1/Week 12 comparison

  * These are powerful tools for future check-ins and accountability

* **Individual Follow-Up (Optional)**

  * If any disciple's Week 12 assessment revealed ongoing struggles, check in personally

  * Offer continued support, counseling referrals, or pastoral care

* Who showed the most growth?

* Who is ready to start thinking about multiplication?

* Who needs more time and focused attention?

* What adjustments do we need to make moving forward?

**Next Steps:**

* Plan the next 12 weeks (or continue with the DNA Discipleship material)

* Begin praying about multiplication timeline

* Identify who might be ready to co-lead a future group


# 

# **After the 12 Weeks**

# **What's Next?**

Congratulations\! 

You've completed the 90-Day Toolkit. But this isn't the end—it's just the beginning.

## **Customize Your Own Rhythm**

Now that you understand the tools, create your own rhythm:

* Mix and match tools based on group needs  
* Add new tools as you discover them  
* Follow the Holy Spirit's leading

# 

# 

# **Final Thoughts for Leaders**

**You did it.**

You walked with your disciples for 8 weeks. You created a safe space. You taught them to hear God. You challenged them to step out in faith. You measured growth.

**But here's the truth:**  
The tools don't make disciples. The Holy Spirit does. You're just a faithful steward of what He's doing.

**Don't get discouraged if:**

* Growth is slower than you expected  
* Someone drops out  
* You make mistakes  
* Not every week goes perfectly

**Discipleship is messy. It's slow. It's hard.**  
But it's worth it.

**Keep going.**

Keep investing.  
Keep trusting the process.  
Keep pointing people to Jesus.

And when it's time, release them to do the same.

**Now go make disciples who make disciples.**
