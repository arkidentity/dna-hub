## **What Is the 90-Day Toolkit?**

## The 90-Day Toolkit is a structured guide for leading your DNA group through their first 12 weeks together. It provides week-by-week lesson plans, activities, and tools that build on each other to create a foundation for lifelong discipleship.

## **This toolkit is designed for:**

* ## New DNA groups in their first 90 days together

* ## Leaders who want a structured starting point for Phase 1 (Foundation Building)

* ## Groups working through Months 1-3 of the DNA Launch Guide

## **This toolkit is NOT flexible:**

* ## Follow the sequence—each week prepares for the next

* ## Don't skip weeks unless absolutely necessary

* ## Complete all 12 weeks before moving to Phase 2

## 

## **The 12-Week Structure**

## **The toolkit is broken into 3 months, each with a distinct focus:**

### **MONTH 1: Building Habits (Weeks 1-4)**

## **Focus:** Learning the core DNA tools and begin practicing them. The emphasis is on connection and trust—creating a safe environment where vulnerability can flourish.

| Week | Tool | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Week 1** | **Life Assessment** | **Understanding where we are** |
| **Week 2** | **3D Journal** | **Learning to hear God through Scripture** |
| **Week 3** | **4D Prayer Rhythm** | **Establishing daily prayer rhythm** |
| **Week 4** | **Creed Cards** | **Building theological foundation** |

## **What to watch for:**

* ## Are disciples showing up consistently?

* ## Are they engaging in the daily habits (3D Journal, 4D Prayer)?

* ## Is trust beginning to form?

## **Red flags:**

* ## Inconsistent attendance

* ## Resistance to daily habits

* ## Surface-level sharing (no vulnerability)

### 

### **MONTH 2: GOING DEEPER (Weeks 5-8)**

## **Focus:** 

## Experiencing the tools in community. The emphasis is on vulnerability and ownership—disciples take more responsibility for their growth and begin to minister to one another.

| Week | Tool | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Week 5** | **Q\&A Deep Dive** | **Addressing doubts and questions** |
| **Week 6** | **Listening Prayer Circle** | **Hearing God for others** |

## **What to watch for:**

* ## Increased vulnerability in sharing

* ## Disciples praying for each other with confidence

* ## Ownership of spiritual growth (not passive)

* ## Boldness in evangelism and mission

## **Red flags:**

* ## Still guarded or surface-level

* ## Unwilling to step out in faith (prayer, evangelism)

* ## Apathy or disengagement

### 

### **MONTH 3: BREAKTHROUGH (Weeks 9-12)**

## **Focus:** 

## Disciples are ready to go deeper. The emphasis is on confidence and competence—addressing root issues, breaking strongholds, and preparing for Phase 2 (where they'll begin co-leading and facilitating).

| Week | Tool | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Week 9** | **Breaking Strongholds (Reveal, Renounce, Replace)** | **Breaking down lies and strongholds** |
| **Week 10** | **Identity Shift Workshop** | **Building up identity in Christ** |
| **Week 11** | **Spiritual Gifts Test & Activation** | **Activating calling and gifting** |
| **Week 12** | **Life Assessment Revisited** | **Measuring growth and setting new goals** |

## **What to watch for:**

* ## Significant breakthroughs (tears, freedom, revelation)

* ## Disciples facilitating parts of meetings

* ## Excitement about multiplying/leading others

* ## Mastery of DNA tools (3D, 4D, Listening Prayer, Creed Cards)

## **Red flags:**

* ## No measurable growth from Week 1 to Week 12

##  **Key Principles**

### **1\. Connection Before Correction**

Build trust first. Don't correct theology or behavior until you've earned relational equity.

### **2\. Trust Before Transformation**

Disciples won't be vulnerable if they don't feel safe. Create a culture of grace, not judgment.

### **3\. Relationship Before Revelation**

God speaks most clearly in the context of relationships. Prioritize connection with Him and with one another.

### **4\. Model First, Then Release**

Leaders demonstrate vulnerability, obedience, and faith before asking disciples to do the same.

### **5\. Daily Habits \= Transformation**

The tools work when they're practiced daily. 

3D Journal \+ 4D Prayer \= the foundation of a disciple's life.

## 

## **What Happens After Week 12?**

### **Evaluate Using the Phase 1 Checklist**

After completing Week 12, assess whether your disciples are ready to move to Phase 2\. Ask yourself:

* \[ \] Are disciples showing up consistently (80%+ attendance)?  
* \[ \] Are they engaging in group chat and communication?  
* \[ \] Are they demonstrating vulnerability and trust?  
* \[ \] Are they teachable and receiving correction well?  
* \[ \] Are they practicing spiritual disciplines independently (3D, 4D)?  
* \[ \] Have they addressed at least one major stronghold or lie?  
* \[ \] Have they mastered the DNA tools (3D, 4D, Listening Prayer, Creed Cards)?  
* \[ \] Are they expressing readiness to lead or facilitate?

**If 6+ are true:** Move to Phase 2

**If fewer than 6:** Extend Phase 1, identify gaps, and work on specific areas

### **Phase 2: Growth & Empowerment (Months 4-6)**

## In Phase 2, disciples begin **co-facilitating** meetings. They lead 50% of the content while you coach from the side.

## **What changes:**

* ## You stop following a rigid weekly structure

* ## Disciples help choose topics based on group needs

* ## You introduce **Supplemental Lessons** (standalone topics for continued growth)

* ## Disciples practice leading discussions, prayer, and ministry

## **Goal of Phase 2:** Build confidence and competence in facilitation

## ---

### **Phase 3: Multiplication Preparation (Months 7-12)**

## In Phase 3, disciples facilitate **75%+ of meetings**. You're primarily coaching and preparing them to launch their own groups.

## **What changes:**

* ## Disciples lead almost everything (teaching, prayer, ministry)

* ## You focus on identifying and equipping future DNA leaders

* ## You begin planning for multiplication (who will lead their own group?)

* ## You use the **DNA Readiness Quiz** to assess multiplication readiness

## **Goal of Phase 3:** Launch disciples into their own DNA groups

## **The Big Picture: Phases 0-3**

| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Leader Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 0:  Pre-Launch** | Weeks \-6 to 0 | DNA Manual, Launch Guide, Dashboard, with Co-Leader | Solo prep & team building |
| **Phase 1:  Foundation Building** | Months 1-3 (90 Days) | Use 90-Day Toolkit  (Weeks 1-12) | Teaching & modeling |
| **Phase 2: Growth & Empowerment** | Months 4-6 | Disciples co-facilitate, use Supplemental Lessons | Coaching |
| **Phase 3: Multiplication Prep** | Months 7-12 | Disciples facilitate 75%+, prepare to launch own groups | Releasing  |

## 

## **Daily Habits: Utilizing the DNA app**

## The 90-Day Toolkit introduces two **non-negotiable daily habits** in Weeks 2-3: 

## These tools can be accessed in the DNA app.

### **3D Journal (Week 2\)**

* ## 10-15 minutes daily

* ## Read Scripture → Process it through Head (understand), Heart (apply), Hands (obey)

* ## Use the DNA app or paper journal

### **4D Prayer (Week 3\)**

* ## 10-15 minutes daily

* ## Revere (worship), Reflect (gratitude), Request (intercession), Rest (listen)

* ## Use the 4D Prayer feature in the DNA app

## **Total time commitment:** 20- 30 minutes per day

## **Why this matters:** Disciples who journal and pray daily for 90 days will be **unrecognizable** from who they were at the start. This is where transformation happens—not in weekly meetings, but in daily rhythms.

## 

## **Leader Expectations**

### **Before You Start the 90-Day Toolkit:**

* ## \[ \] Complete the DNA Discipleship Manual (6 sessions)

* ## \[ \] Work through DNA Launch Guide Phases 0

* ## \[ \] Have DNA Groups Dashboard access

* ## \[ \] Add your disciples to the dashboard

* ## \[ \] Send Week 1 Life Assessment links

### **During the 90 Days:**

* ## \[ \] Prepare for each week 2-3 days in advance

* ## \[ \] Model vulnerability—go first in sharing

* ## \[ \] Practice daily habits yourself (3D Journal, 4D Prayer)

* ## \[ \] Follow up with disciples individually between meetings

* ## \[ \] Track progress using your DNA Groups Dashboard

* ## \[ \] Debrief with your co-leader after each meeting

### **After Week 12:**

* ## \[ \] Review Week 1 vs. Week 12 comparison reports for each disciple

* ## \[ \] Evaluate readiness for Phase 2 using the checklist

* ## \[ \] Celebrate growth and address any stagnation

* ## \[ \] Vision cast for Phase 2 (co-facilitation and continued growth)

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

### **1\. Skipping Weeks or Changing the Order**

Each week builds on the previous one. Don't skip ahead or rearrange.

### **2\. Not Modeling First**

If you're not journaling daily, don't expect your disciples to. Leaders set the pace.

### **3\. Rushing Through Meetings**

Give space for the Holy Spirit. Don't cram everything into 90 minutes if it needs 120\.

### **4\. Ignoring Red Flags**

If someone isn't engaging, address it privately. Don't wait until Week 12\.

### **5\. Making It About Information, Not Transformation**

The goal isn't to complete lessons—it's to make disciples. Prioritize heart change over curriculum.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What if someone misses a week?**

Catch them up individually before the next meeting. Don't repeat a week for one person.

### **What if someone isn't doing the daily habits?**

Address it privately. Ask why. Remove barriers. Create accountability. They may not be ready for DNA.

### **What if we finish early or need more time in a session?**

Adjust as needed. The times are guidelines, not laws. Follow the Holy Spirit.

### **What if someone needs deeper ministry (trauma, abuse, etc.)?**

Offer to connect them with a counselor or pastor. Don't try to be their therapist—be their discipler.

### **Can I add my own content or lessons?**

Not during the first 90 days. Follow the toolkit exactly. After Week 12, you have freedom to customize in Phase 2\.

## **Final Thoughts**

## **You're about to embark on a 90-day journey that will change lives.**

## This toolkit gives you structure, but the Holy Spirit does the work. Trust the process. Trust God. Trust that He will meet your disciples exactly where they are.

### **By the end of Week 12, your disciples should:**

* ## Know how to hear God daily (3D Journal, 4D Prayer)

* ## Understand core biblical truths (Creed Cards)

* ## Be comfortable praying for others (Listening Prayer)

* ## Have addressed at least one major stronghold (Reveal, Renounce, Replace)

* ## Be ready to co-facilitate in Phase 2

## 

## **If they can do these things, you've succeeded.**

## Now go make disciples who make disciples.
