# THE 90-DAY TOOLKIT
## A Pastor's Guide to the Tools That Form Disciples

*A discipleship resource from DNA Discipleship — dnadiscipleship.com*

---

The 90-Day Toolkit is a 12-week curriculum that walks disciples through a sequence of tools designed to produce lasting transformation. Each tool builds on the last. None are optional. Together, they create the conditions for a disciple to hear God daily, break free from what holds them back, and step into who they were made to be.

This guide gives you a one-page overview of each tool — what it is, why it matters, and what transformation looks like when a disciple engages with it fully.

## WEEK 1 — LIFE ASSESSMENT
### Understanding Where We Are

**What it is:** A 42-question self-assessment covering 7 areas of discipleship health — Relationship with God, Spiritual Freedom, Identity & Emotions, Relationships, Calling & Purpose, Lifestyle & Stewardship, and Spiritual Fruit. Disciples rate themselves on a 1–5 scale and answer open-ended reflection questions. Results go directly to the leader's dashboard.

**Why it matters:** You can't grow what you don't measure. Most disciples have never honestly evaluated their spiritual life. They assume they're doing fine — or assume they're beyond help. The Life Assessment cuts through both. It surfaces hidden struggles, false beliefs, and blind spots that would otherwise stay buried for years. It also gives leaders a specific, data-informed picture of every person in their group before the first week is over.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who completes Week 1 honestly begins the journey with self-awareness. They know where they're starting. That clarity is the first act of courage — and it sets the tone for everything that follows.

## WEEK 2 — THE 3D JOURNAL
### Learning to Hear God Through Scripture

**What it is:** A daily Bible engagement method structured around three dimensions — Head (What does this passage reveal about God?), Heart (What is God saying to me personally right now?), and Hands (What does God want me to do with this?). Takes 10–15 minutes. Accessed through the DNA app or paper journal.

**Why it matters:** Most Christians read their Bible occasionally. The 3D Journal changes reading into *encounter*. It forces a disciple to move from information to application to obedience — every single day. The consistency is the point. A disciple who journals daily for one year has 365 documented conversations with God. They learn to recognize His voice. They build a record of His faithfulness. They grow the spiritual muscle memory that sustains them through anything.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who journals daily becomes someone who hears from God before they hear from anyone else. Decision-making changes. Confidence grows. The Bible stops being a book they read and starts being a voice they listen to.

## WEEK 3 — 4D PRAYER
### Establishing a Daily Prayer Rhythm

**What it is:** A structured daily prayer framework built around four movements — Revere (worship God for who He is), Reflect (thank God for what He's done), Request (intercede for others through prayer cards), and Rest (be still and listen). Takes 10–15 minutes. Accessed through the Prayer tab in the DNA app.

**Why it matters:** Most Christians pray reactively — when things go wrong. The 4D Prayer rhythm trains disciples to pray proactively, consistently, and intercessorily. Rooted in Ezekiel 22:30 and Hebrews 7:25, it connects disciples to their identity as intercessors — people who stand in the gap for others the way Jesus always intercedes for us. The prayer card system makes intercession concrete and trackable. Answered prayers become testimonies.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who prays daily through the 4D rhythm develops a prayer life that is relational, not transactional. They begin expecting God to answer. They start seeing fruit — answered prayers, changed people, divine appointments — and their faith competes forward.

---

## WEEK 4 — CREED CARDS
### Building on Historic Christian Truth

**What it is:** A set of doctrinal cards — each focused on one essential Christian belief rooted in Scripture and church history. Every card presents the original Greek or Hebrew word, a concise definition, a key Scripture, and a reflection question. Used through a 4-step method: Discuss (before flipping), Define (read the card), Deepen (dig into Scripture), Discuss again (apply it personally).

**Why it matters:** Disciples who don't know what they believe can't defend it, can't live it, and can't teach it. Creed Cards give every disciple — regardless of background — a theological foundation in bite-sized, conversation-ready form. They protect against false teaching, unite the group around shared truth, and give disciples language for their faith. Starting with Faith, Gospel, and Grace ensures the core of the Christian message is grounded before anything else is built on top of it.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who works through Creed Cards stops borrowing their theology from culture or feelings and starts rooting it in Scripture and 2,000 years of Christian witness. They can explain what they believe and why — to a skeptic, a seeker, or their own doubting heart.

## WEEK 5 — Q&A DEEP DIVE
### Addressing Doubts, Questions, and Confusion

**What it is:** A full meeting dedicated to the questions disciples have been afraid to ask — theological, practical, and personal. No question is off-limits. The leader does not need to have all the answers. The process: collect all questions first, then work through them together using Scripture as the final authority.

**Why it matters:** Unanswered questions become unspoken doubts. Doubts become strongholds. By Week 5, disciples have enough trust in the group to voice what they've been sitting on — questions about suffering, salvation, sin, the supernatural, and more. This week creates a culture of honesty that prevents intellectual barriers from quietly undermining everything else being built. It also teaches disciples how to think biblically about hard things rather than avoiding them.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who has been given permission to ask hard questions without judgment stops hiding their doubts and starts bringing them into the light. Faith becomes more honest — and more durable. They learn that questions are not the enemy of faith; unexplored questions are.

---

## WEEK 6 — LISTENING PRAYER CIRCLE
### Hearing God for Others

**What it is:** A structured group activity in which each disciple prays quietly for the person to their right, waits in silence to hear from God for that person, and then shares what they received — an impression, a picture, a Scripture, a word. The receiver responds to what resonates. Leaders coach in real time.

**Why it matters:** Most disciples have never been taught that they can hear God for someone else. This week demystifies the prophetic and makes it accessible, practice-based, and safe. Rooted in 1 Corinthians 14, it activates disciples as encouragers and intercessors — not just recipients of ministry, but ministers to one another. The Listening Prayer Circle is often the week where disciples realize, for the first time, that God actually speaks through them.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who practices listening prayer stops thinking of the supernatural as someone else's territory. They begin to look for what God wants to say in every conversation. Relationships deepen. Confidence in prayer grows. The group becomes a place where people genuinely encounter God through each other.

---

## WEEK 7 — OUTREACH & MISSION
### Applying Faith in the Real World

**What it is:** The group goes out together on a mission activity — street evangelism, homeless ministry, prayer walk, hospital visit, neighborhood cookout, or campus outreach. The meeting is replaced by action. Leaders model first, then release disciples to lead. Pairs are kept together for safety and accountability.

**Why it matters:** Discipleship that never leaves the room produces disciples who are informed but not transformed. Jesus didn't just teach His disciples — He sent them. Week 7 does the same. It pushes every person past their comfort zone and into dependence on the Holy Spirit. Faith that has only been exercised in safe environments is fragile. Faith that has been risked in the real world is resilient. This week also generates fresh testimonies — stories of God showing up when disciples stepped out.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who has gone on mission stops seeing evangelism as someone else's calling. They carry a boldness they did not have before. They have a story — a specific moment where God used them. That story becomes fuel for everything that follows.

---

## WEEK 8 — TESTIMONY BUILDING
### Capturing and Sharing God's Faithfulness

**What it is:** A debrief of the Week 7 outreach followed by a structured testimony workshop using the STORY Framework — Struggle (before), Turning Point (the moment), Outcome (after), Reflection (what you learned), Your Invitation (the call to others). Disciples develop two testimonies: a salvation or transformation story, and a recent "God moment."

**Why it matters:** Disciples who cannot articulate what God has done in their lives are disarmed as witnesses. The STORY Framework gives every disciple — regardless of how dramatic their story is — a structure for telling it clearly, specifically, and compellingly. Revelation 12:11 says we overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony. Testimony is a weapon. Teaching disciples to wield it is not optional.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who can tell their story well begins to see their life as evidence of God's faithfulness. They stop underestimating what God has done. They become witnesses — not because they were assigned to, but because they have something real to say.

## WEEK 9 — BREAKING STRONGHOLDS
### Reveal, Renounce, Replace

**What it is:** A Spirit-led deliverance session structured around three movements. Reveal — disciples ask God to surface lies they are believing about Him, themselves, or others. Renounce — they verbally break agreement with the lie in Jesus' name, confess, and forgive where needed. Replace — they ask God what truth He is giving them in return, receive it, and declare it out loud.

**Why it matters:** Eight weeks of tools, trust, and community have created the conditions for this moment. Disciples are now safe enough to go deep. A stronghold is a lie that has become entrenched — a fortress in the mind that distorts how a person sees God, themselves, and their future. No amount of Bible knowledge or prayer habit can fully overcome a lie that has never been named and renounced. This week does the deep work that the other weeks have been preparing disciples for. It is often the most significant meeting of the 12.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who has gone through Reveal, Renounce, Replace often describes it as a weight lifting. Old patterns of shame, fear, and self-rejection lose their grip. They have a new truth to stand on — one they declared out loud in front of witnesses. That declaration becomes their weapon when the lie tries to return.

---

## WEEK 10 — IDENTITY SHIFT
### Who You Are in Christ

**What it is:** A teaching and activation session that helps disciples close the gap between how they see themselves and how God sees them. Disciples do a mirror test (honest self-assessment), a listening prayer exercise (asking God what He sees), and then compare the two. Teaching covers false humility, the Gideon encounter, and God dependence. Each disciple builds an Identity Battle Plan — a personal document of "Who I am" statements backed by Scripture, used as a weapon when the enemy attacks.

**Why it matters:** Identity is the battlefield. The enemy does not attack behavior first — he attacks identity, because behavior follows belief. A disciple who does not know who they are in Christ will keep living like who they used to be. Week 10 builds on the freedom of Week 9 by replacing the demolished lie with a Scripture-anchored identity that can be declared and defended. The Identity Battle Plan turns truth into a tool disciples can use every day for the rest of their lives.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple with a clear, Scripture-rooted identity stops agreeing with the enemy's accusations. They stop performing for acceptance, hiding from failure, or waiting for someone to tell them they are enough. They know who they are. And they can prove it from the Word.

## WEEK 11 — SPIRITUAL GIFTS
### Discover Your Design to Serve

**What it is:** Disciples complete the Spiritual Gifts Assessment (sent 3–4 days in advance) covering three tiers: Tier 1 — How You Serve (Romans 12 gifts), Tier 2 — Supernatural Empowerment (1 Corinthians 12 gifts), and Tier 3 — Leadership Calling (Ephesians 4 five-fold). The meeting reviews results, teaches on the Body of Christ, and closes with impartation (laying on of hands) and immediate activation — each disciple uses their gift in the room before the meeting ends.

**Why it matters:** A disciple who does not know how God has wired them will either try to serve in ways that exhaust them or disengage entirely. Spiritual gifts are not a personality curiosity — they are the Father's design for how His love gets expressed through each person for the common good of the Body (1 Corinthians 12:7). When disciples know their gifts, they stop comparing themselves to others and start contributing what only they can offer. Activation on the spot — not later, not theoretically — is what makes this week decisive rather than informational.

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who knows and has activated their gifts moves from spectator to participant in the Body of Christ. They stop waiting for the professionals to do the work of ministry. They show up knowing they have something to give — and that the Body is incomplete without it.

## WEEK 12 — LIFE ASSESSMENT REVISITED
### Measuring Growth and Setting New Goals

**What it is:** Disciples retake the same 42-question Life Assessment from Week 1. The dashboard auto-generates a side-by-side comparison report for each person — showing score changes across all 7 categories, the questions with the most growth, and open-ended responses from both weeks. Leaders celebrate measurable wins, address remaining gaps honestly, and cast vision for what comes next.

**Why it matters:** Growth that is not measured is invisible. By Week 12, transformation has been happening — but disciples often can't see it because they're inside it. The comparison report makes growth concrete and undeniable. It also surfaces the areas that still need work, which gives leaders and disciples a clear-eyed basis for Phase 2 planning. This week closes the loop on the 90 days and answers the question every disciple is quietly asking: *Did any of this actually work?*

**What transformation looks like:** A disciple who sees their Week 1 and Week 12 scores side by side sees the evidence of what God has done. That evidence builds faith for what comes next. They stop doubting the process. They begin to believe that continued growth — and eventually multiplication — is not just possible for someone else. It is possible for them.

## THE RESULT OF 12 WEEKS

By the end of the 90-Day Toolkit, a disciple should be able to:

- **Hear God daily** through Scripture and prayer (3D Journal + 4D Prayer)
- **Know what they believe and why** (Creed Cards)
- **Stand in the gap for others** through consistent intercession (4D Prayer Cards)
- **Hear God for others** with growing confidence (Listening Prayer)
- **Tell their story** in a way that builds faith and points to Jesus (Testimony)
- **Name and break** the lies that have held them back (Reveal, Renounce, Replace)
- **Know who they are in Christ** and defend it with Scripture (Identity Battle Plan)
- **Know how God wired them** and actively serve with their gifts (Spiritual Gifts)
- **Measure their own growth** and set goals for what's next (Life Assessment)

This is not a program. It is a formation process. Each tool is a practice that disciples carry for the rest of their lives. The 90 days are just where they learn to pick them up.
