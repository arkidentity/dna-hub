# **THE 90-DAY TOOLKIT**

## **Month 2: Building (Weeks 5-8)**

##

## 

*A discipleship resource from DNA Discipleship*

***dnadiscipleship.com***

## **From Foundation to Action**

### **What You've Accomplished So Far**

**Congratulations—you've completed Month 1\.** Your disciples have:

* ✅ Assessed their spiritual lives (Week 1\)  
* ✅ Learned to hear God through Scripture (3D Journal)  
* ✅ Established daily prayer rhythms (4D Prayer)  
* ✅ Built theological foundation (Creed Cards)

**The tools are in their hands. Now it's time to use them.**

---

### **What Changes in Month 2**

**Month 1 was about LEARNING the tools.** 

**Month 2 is about EXPERIENCING the tools in community.**

**The Shift:**

* **From individual practice → corporate experience**  
* **From knowledge → application**  
* **From safe conversations → vulnerable sharing**  
* **From the classroom → the mission field**

**Month 2 is where discipleship gets messy, beautiful, and supernatural.**

### 

### **The 4-Week Flow**

| Week | Focus | What Happens |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Week 5** | **Q\&A Deep Dive** | Address doubts, questions, confusion—create safety for honesty |
| **Week 6** | **Listening Prayer Circle** | Hear God for one another—activate the prophetic |
| **Week 7** | **Outreach/Mission Activity** | GO out and DO—apply faith in the real world |
| **Week 8** | **Testimony Time \+ Debrief** | Process what God did—build powerful testimonies |

**Notice the progression:**

1. **Clarify questions** (Week 5\)  
2. **Hear God together** (Week 6\)  
3. **GO on mission** (Week 7\)  
4. **Celebrate what God did** (Week 8\)

This is discipleship in action.

---

### **What to Expect**

**Increased Vulnerability:** Disciples will begin sharing at a deeper level. Expect tears, breakthroughs, and "I've never told anyone this before" moments.

**Supernatural Encounters:** The Listening Prayer Circle (Week 6\) often produces powerful prophetic words. Disciples will see God speak through them for the first time.

**Outreach Nervousness:** Week 7 will push everyone outside their comfort zones. That's the point. Faith grows through risk.

**Fresh Testimonies:** By Week 8, disciples will have fresh stories of God's activity from the outreach. These testimonies will fuel their faith for months to come.

---

### **Leader Prep for Month 2**

**Before Week 5:**

* Review Q\&A coaching tips (Week 5)—you don't need all the answers  
* Prepare a few of your own vulnerable questions to model openness

**Before Week 6:**

* Pray for increased sensitivity to the Holy Spirit  
* Review Listening Prayer Circle format—create a safe, encouraging environment

**Before Week 7:**

* **CRITICAL:** Plan the outreach activity (see Week 7 options)  
* Communicate details clearly to disciples: what, when, where, what to bring  
* Pray for divine appointments and boldness

**After Week 6:**

* **CRITICAL:** Send the Testimony Development Worksheet to all disciples  
* This prepares them for Week 8 testimony workshop

---

### 

### **Common Month 2 Challenges**

**Challenge 1: "I don't have questions" (Week 5\)** → They do—they're just afraid to voice them. Model vulnerability by sharing YOUR questions first.

**Challenge 2: "I can't hear God" (Week 6\)** → Most disciples have never been taught to listen. Remind them: God WANTS to speak. Create space, silence, and encouragement.

**Challenge 3: "I'm scared to do outreach" (Week 7\)** → Good. That means they're relying on God, not themselves. Pray together before, during, and after.

**Challenge 4: "I don't have a testimony" (Week 8\)** → Everyone has testimonies—they just don't recognize them. Help them see God in everyday moments.

### **What Success Looks Like**

By the end of Month 2, disciples should be:

* ✅ **Asking honest questions** without fear of judgment  
* ✅ **Hearing God for others** with growing confidence  
* ✅ **Stepping outside comfort zones** in evangelism/mission  
* ✅ **Recognizing and articulating God's activity** in their lives  
* ✅ **Ministering to one another** (not just receiving from leaders)

**If you see these signs, you're ready for Month 3: Breakthrough.**

### **A Word to Leaders**

**Month 2 is where you transition from teacher to facilitator.**

* Let disciples lead more  
* Ask more questions, give fewer answers  
* Create space for the Holy Spirit to move  
* Celebrate every risk they take, even if it doesn't go perfectly

**Your disciples are more ready than you think.**

Trust the process. Trust the Holy Spirit. Trust that God is at work.

### **Let's Begin Month 2\.**

# 

## **Week 5:** 

# **Q\&A Deep Dive**

## **Addressing Doubts, Questions & Confusion**

### **Purpose**

To create a safe space for disciples to ask hard questions, voice doubts, and wrestle with theological confusion without fear of judgment.

### **Why This Matters**

Unanswered questions become unspoken doubts. Doubts turn into strongholds. This week prevents that by bringing everything into the light.

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

Leaders:

* Text disciples mid-week: "What questions about God, the Bible, or faith have you been afraid to ask? Bring them this week. No question is off-limits."  
* Pray for wisdom and discernment  
* Don't feel pressure to have all the answers—sometimes the best answer is "I don't know, but let's find out together."  
* Prepare a few of your own questions to model vulnerability

Disciples:

* Come with 1-2 questions written down  
* Be honest about what you're really wondering

### 

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening (5 minutes)**

* Set the tone: "This is a safe space. Ask anything. We won't judge you. We're here to pursue truth together."  
* Brief prayer for wisdom and Holy Spirit guidance

### **2\. Ground Rules (5 minutes)**

**Establish guidelines before diving in:**

* No question is stupid or off-limits

* We pursue truth, not just winning arguments

* It's okay to say "I don't know"

* We point to Scripture as our ultimate authority

* We can disagree and still love each other

* Doubt is not the opposite of faith—certainty is. Questions are part of growth.

### **3\. Question Gathering (5 minutes)**

* Go around the circle—each person shares their question

* Write them all down

* Don't answer yet—just collect them

### **4\. Q\&A Discussion (70 minutes)**

**Process for each question:**

1. Read the question out loud

2. Ask: "What do you think? What does Scripture say?"

3. Let the GROUP wrestle with it first (don't jump in as the expert)

4. Leaders provide biblical clarity and direction

5. Point to Scripture as much as possible

6. If you don't know, say so: "Great question. Let me research that and we'll revisit it."

### 

### **Common Question Categories:**

**Theological Questions:**

* "If God is good, why does He allow suffering?"

* "What about people who never hear the gospel?"

* "Is hell real? How could a loving God send people there?"

* "What about dinosaurs and the age of the earth?"

* "Can Christians lose their salvation?"

**Practical Questions:**

* "How do I know if I'm really saved?"

* "How do I hear God's voice?"

* "Is it okay to \[insert behavior\]?"

* "What about tattoos/drinking/entertainment/etc.?"

* "How much should I give financially?"

**Personal Struggle Questions:**

* "What if I don't feel God's presence anymore?"

* "What if I'm mad at God?"

* "I struggle with \[sin\]. Does that mean I'm not really a Christian?"

* "How do I forgive someone who hurt me?"

**Controversial Questions:**

* "What's the deal with speaking in tongues?"

* "Can women be pastors?"

* "What does the Bible say about \[insert hot-button issue\]?"

### **5\. Closing (5 minutes)**

* Thank them for their honesty  
* Pray for continued revelation and understanding  
* Remind them: "Faith isn't the absence of questions—it's trusting God even when we don't have all the answers."

### 

### 

### **Q\&A Coaching Tips**

**How to Answer Well:**

**1\. Start with Scripture**  
"Let's see what the Bible says." Always anchor answers in God's Word, not opinion.

**2\. Ask before you answer**  
"What do you think?" Sometimes they know the answer—they need permission to believe it.

**3\. Admit when you don't know**  
"That's a great question. I don't know the answer, but let's find out together."

**4\. Distinguish between clear biblical truth and secondary issues**  
Some things are non-negotiable (the gospel, Jesus' divinity, salvation by faith). Other things are secondary (worship styles, end times views, etc.).

**5\. Address the heart behind the question**  
 Sometimes the question isn't really about theology—it's about pain, fear, or unbelief. Go there.

**Example:**  
Question: "Why did God let my mom get cancer?"  
Answer: Don't just give a theological answer about suffering. Address the pain: "That's devastating. I'm so sorry. Can we talk about where you are with God in the middle of that?"

**6\. Don't be defensive**  
If they're questioning something you believe strongly, don't get defensive. Stay curious. "Tell me more about why you think that."

**7\. Point to mystery when appropriate**  
Some questions don't have clean answers. "I don't fully understand why God allows that, but I do know His character—He's good, He's loving, and He's trustworthy."

---

### **Red Flags to Watch For**

**Signs of Spiritual Crisis:**

* Anger toward God  
* Deep doubt about core doctrines  
* Questioning their salvation repeatedly  
* Bitterness or resentment

**Don't dismiss these.** They need pastoral care, not just theological answers.

**Signs of False Teaching Influence:**

* Questions that sound like talking points from false teachers  
* Resistance to clear biblical teaching  
* Attraction to "secret knowledge" or conspiracy theories

**Address directly:** "Where did you hear that? Let's compare it to Scripture."

### **Leader Debrief (After the Meeting)**

* What questions revealed deeper issues?  
* Did anyone ask something we need to follow up on privately?  
* What questions do we need to research more?  
* Are there patterns of confusion we need to address?

**Follow-Up:**

* Research any unanswered questions and share findings in group chat  
* Check in individually with anyone whose questions revealed spiritual crisis  
* Recommend resources (books, sermons, articles) for deeper study


# **Week 6:** 

# **Listening Prayer**

## **Activating the Gift of Hearing God for Others**

### 

### **Purpose**

To create a culture where disciples learn to hear God's voice for one another, give and receive encouragement, and grow in confidence in the supernatural relationship with the Holy Spirit.

### **Why This Matters**

Many Christians have never been taught to hear God for others. The Listening Prayer Circle demystifies this gift and gives everyone practice in a safe environment. This should become natural and not some weird mystic practice.

**Preparation (Before the Meeting)**  
Leaders:

* Pray for increased sensitivity to the Holy Spirit  
* Prepare a brief teaching on the prophetic (5-10 minutes)  
* Be ready to model sharing what God says  
* Create a safe, encouraging atmosphere

Disciples:

* Come with an open heart  
* No preparation needed (but pray for sensitivity to the Holy Spirit)

### 

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening & Worship (10 minutes)**

* Worship invites God's presence  
* Play a few worship songs if this fits your group  
* Brief prayer inviting the Holy Spirit to speak

### **2\. Teaching on Hearing God for Others (15 minutes)**

**Does God still speak to people under the New Covenant?**  
God loves us and loves to be in communication with us. He knows all things therefore He can reveal inside information to those who ask. It's not fortune-telling or manipulation—it's edification, encouragement, and comfort (1 Cor 14:3).

**Communicating with God is for everyone**  
1 Cor 14:1 says “*Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophecy.”* This isn't just for super-spiritual people. It's for every believer. God wants to speak through you to encourage others.

God has given each of us an imagination. And we can use this imagination for good or for evil, as we can do with all things in life. What if you could surrender your imagination to the Holy Spirit? How would God speak to you through your imagination? Let’s call this the sanctified mind.

**Using your sanctified mind:**

* Impressions (a sense or feeling)  
* Smell (an aroma that brings up a memory)  
* Pictures (mental images)  
* Scripture (a verse comes to mind)  
* Words (a stream of thought from Holy Spirit)  
  **How to test it:**  
* Does it align with Scripture?  
* Does it edify and encourage?  
* Does it produce life or fear?  
* Do others confirm it?  
    
  **How to deliver a prophetic word:**  
* Start with "I sense..." or "I heard…"  
* Speak humbly, not dogmatically  
* Give the person freedom to test it  
* Don't use prophecy to control or manipulate

### **3\. Listening Prayer Activity (50 minutes)**

**How it works:**

* Sit in a circle (Have a digital notepad ready)  
* Each person prays for the person to their right (clockwise)  
* Take 3-5 minutes of silence to listen for that person  
* Take notes on everything you receive, even if it doesn’t make sense.  
* Go around the circle—each person shares what they received  
* The receiver listens and responds  
  **Round 1: Practice Round (20 minutes) Optional**  
* “God, when you look at \_\_\_\_\_\_, what do you see?”  
* Share what you sense (2-3 minutes each)  
* Receiver responds: "What resonated? What didn't?"  
* Leaders give feedback and coaching  
  **Round 2: Real Round (30 minutes)**  
* Repeat the process, but deeper (Encourage them to ask more questions as they listen)  
* “God, when you look at \_\_\_\_\_\_, what do you see?”  
* Longer listening time (5 minutes)  
* Longer sharing time (3-4 minutes each)  
* More vulnerability  
  **Leader's Role:**  
* Go first to model  
* Give real-time coaching: "That's good. What else are you hearing?"  
* If someone is way off, gently redirect: "That doesn’t sound like something God would say. We should pray about this."  
* If someone nails it, celebrate: "That was beautiful. Did you feel that?"

### 

### **4\. Debrief & Feedback (10 minutes)**

* How did that feel?  
* What was hard? What was surprising?  
* Did you hear God more clearly than you expected?  
* What do you need to grow in?

### **5\. Closing Prayer (5 minutes)**

* Thank God for speaking  
* Pray for continued growth in hearing God for others

### **Listening Prayer Coaching Tips**

**Common Struggles:**  
"I didn't hear anything."  
That's okay. Sometimes the gift takes time to activate. Ask them:

* "What was the first thing that came to mind?"  
* "Did you see any pictures or impressions?"  
* "What do you sense about this person generally?"

**Start with encouragement.**  
**They can speak life even without a specific word from God.**

**"I think I heard something, but I'm not sure it's God."**  
Say it anyway. We learn by doing. "I sense..." gives them an out if it's a bit off or generic.

**"What if I'm wrong?"**  
You will be. And that's okay. We're learning. Grace covers the process. Just stay humble.

**Someone gives a "word" that's clearly from their own thoughts.**  
Gently redirect: "I appreciate you trying, but I'm not sensing that's from the Lord. Let's try again. Ask God, 'What do YOU want to say to \[name\]?'"

**Someone gives a corrective or heavy word:**  
Be cautious. Most words from God will be encouragement, while others are for  correction. If it's heavy, leaders should test it before releasing it.

### 

### **What to Watch For**

Good Signs:

* People are stepping out in faith  
* Words are landing with the receiver  
* Tears, breakthroughs, or "that's exactly what I needed"  
* Growing confidence

Red Flags:

* Someone is trying to control or manipulate through the activity  
* Words are consistently off or weird  
* Someone is using the activity to make themselves look spiritual  
* Fear or confusion instead of life

### **Leader Debrief (After the Meeting)**

* Who is naturally gifted in hearing God for others?  
* Who struggled? How do we help them?  
* Were there any breakthrough moments?  
* Any concerning moments that need follow-up?

**Follow-Up:**

* Text disciples something encouraging God showed you about them this week  
* Encourage them to ask God to speak about someone in their life

**CRITICAL \- Prepare for Week 8:**

* **IMMEDIATELY after Week 6 meeting**, send all disciples the **Testimony Development Worksheet** (see Week 8 resources)  
* Text the group: "In two weeks (Week 8), we'll be doing Testimony Time where we'll also debrief the outreach from next week. I'm sending you a worksheet to help you prepare powerful testimonies. Please complete it before Week 8\. You'll have experiences from our outreach next week to add to it\!"  
* Follow up after Week 7 outreach: "Great job on the outreach\! Make sure to add any testimonies from that experience to your worksheet. We'll workshop them together in Week 8."

# 

## **Week 7:** 

# **Outreach/Mission**

## **Applying Faith in the Real World**

### **Purpose**

To get disciples out of the classroom and into the mission field. Faith grows through action, risk, and seeing God show up in real-time.

### **Why This Matters**

Discipleship isn't just about knowledge—it's about obedience. Jesus didn't just teach His disciples; He sent them out. This week does the same.

* Role-play the conversation beforehand

**During the outreach:**

* Model first: "Watch me, then you'll try."  
* Start easy: Let them hand out water bottles before asking them to pray for someone.  
* Debrief in real-time: After each encounter, pull aside and ask: "How did that feel? What did you notice?"

**After the outreach:**

* Celebrate every step of obedience, even if nothing "happened"  
* Don't measure success by conversions—measure it by obedience  
* Process fears and disappointments honestly  
  ---

  ---

### **Leader Debrief (After the Outreach)**

* Share testimonies in the group chat  
* Pray for the people you encountered

## **Week 8:** 

# **Testimony Time**

## **Building & Sharing Your Story of God's Faithfulness**

### **Purpose**

To debrief the outreach/mission experience from Week 7, help disciples develop powerful testimonies that glorify God, and train them to recognize God's activity in everyday life—especially through the recent outreach. This week combines REFLECTION (on the mission) and BUILDING (testimonies for the future).

### **Why This Matters**

After going out on mission in Week 7, disciples need space to process what God did. Many will have fresh testimonies from the outreach experience. Additionally, by Week 8, disciples have seven weeks of DNA tools, spiritual growth, and "God moments" to draw from. A well-told testimony can change someone's life—it builds faith (Romans 10:17), overcomes darkness (Revelation 12:11), and gives God glory. This week, we teach disciples HOW to craft and share testimonies that connect with others and point them to Jesus.

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

**Leaders:**

* **CRITICAL:** One week before this meeting (during Week 4), send all disciples the **Testimony Development Worksheet** (see resource below)  
* Prepare 2 of your own testimonies using the worksheet framework:  
  * **Testimony 1:** Your salvation story OR a major life transformation  
  * **Testimony 2:** A recent answer to prayer or "God moment" from the last month   
* Be ready to explain WHY your testimonies are effective (what makes them compelling?)  
* Review the "STORY Framework" teaching (see below)

**Disciples:**

* Complete the **Testimony Development Worksheet** before the meeting  
* Bring at least 1 testimony using the worksheet structure

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening Worship (5 minutes)**

* Sing 1-2 songs of thanksgiving and celebration  
* Worship prepares hearts to see and share God's goodness

### **2\. Outreach Debrief (15 minutes)**

**Facilitate a debrief of the Week 7 outreach/mission experience:**

**Ask the group:**

* "What did you experience during the outreach? What stood out to you?"

* "Where did you see God show up? Any specific moments?"

* "What challenged you? What encouraged you?"

* "Did anyone have a conversation, encounter, or moment that felt significant?"

* "How did this experience grow your faith?"

**Leader's Role:**

* Celebrate every story—big or small

* Help disciples see God's activity in moments they might overlook

* Ask follow-up questions: "What did that teach you about God?"

* Transition: "Many of you just shared fresh testimonies from the outreach. That's exactly what we're going to work on tonight—how to capture and share these stories powerfully."

**Why This Matters:**

This debrief serves as a natural bridge into testimony building. Disciples are processing real experiences of God's activity, which makes the testimony workshop more concrete and immediate.

### **3\. Leader Testimony Modeling (10 minutes)**

**Leader 1 shares first testimony (Salvation/Transformation story):**

* Share your prepared testimony naturally and compellingly  
* After sharing, PAUSE and debrief:

**Ask the group:**

* "What made that testimony easy to follow?"  
* "What details stood out to you?"  
* "What did you learn about God's character from that story?"

**Leader points out key elements:**

* "Notice how I shared WHERE I was before (my struggle/need)"  
* "I told you WHAT God did (specific action/encounter)"  
* "I explained HOW my life changed as a result (transformation)"  
* "This is called the STORY Framework—we'll teach you this tonight"

**Leader 2 shares second testimony (Recent "God moment"):**

* Share your recent answer to prayer or everyday God encounter  
* Again, debrief what made it effective:  
  * Specific details (not vague)  
  * God as the hero (not me)  
  * Honest about the struggle  
  * Clear outcome

**Transition:**

"You all have stories like these. Tonight, we're going to help you BUILD powerful testimonies using the same framework we just modeled. Pull out your Testimony Development Worksheets—we're going to work through them together."

### 

### **4\. Teaching: The STORY Framework (15 minutes)**

**What is a testimony?** A testimony is your personal account of God's activity in your life. It's not just about salvation—it's about every moment God shows up, provides, heals, speaks, guides, or transforms.

* **They build faith** (Romans 10:17 \- "Faith comes by hearing")  
* **They overcome darkness** (Revelation 12:11 \- "We overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony")  
* **They give God glory** (He gets credit, not us)  
* **They connect with non-believers** (stories are universal; people relate to struggle and hope)

**The STORY Framework** (write this on a board or share on screen):  
**S \- STRUGGLE (Before)**

* Where were you before God intervened?  
* What was the problem, need, or pain?  
* What did life look like without God's intervention?  
  **T \- TURNING POINT (The Moment)**

* When/how did God show up?  
* What specific event, encounter, or realization happened?  
* How did you recognize it was God?  
  **O \- OUTCOME (After)**

* What changed as a result?  
* How is your life different now?  
* What freedom, healing, or breakthrough did you experience?  
  **R \- REFLECTION (What You Learned)**

* What did this experience teach you about God?  
* What did it teach you about yourself?  
* How did it grow your faith?  
  **Y \- YOUR INVITATION (The Call)**

* What do you want others to take away from your story?  
* What hope can you offer them?  
* How can they experience God's faithfulness too?

**Examples of testimony types:**

* **Salvation stories** \- How you came to faith in Jesus  
* **Healing testimonies** \- Physical, emotional, or spiritual healing  
* **Provision testimonies** \- God meeting financial, relational, or practical needs  
* **Breakthrough testimonies** \- Freedom from strongholds, addictions, lies  
* **Everyday faithfulness** \- Answered prayers, "God moments," divine appointments

**What makes a testimony POWERFUL:**

✅ **Specific** \- "God provided $500 for rent" (not "God is just so good") 

✅ **Concise** \- 3-5 minutes max (not 20 minutes) 

✅ **God-centered** \- He's the hero, not you 

✅ **Honest** \- Include the struggle, not just the victory 

✅ **Relatable** \- Others can see themselves in your story 

✅ **Hope-filled** \- Points people to Jesus as the answer

**What to avoid:**

❌ Vague generalities \- "God is good" without specifics 

❌ Making yourself the hero \- "I finally figured it out" 

❌ Over-spiritualizing \- Using Christianese non-believers won't understand 

❌ Rambling without structure \- No clear beginning, middle, end 

❌ Leaving out the struggle \- Only sharing the victory makes it unrelatable

### **5\. Testimony Workshop: Building Your Story (35 minutes)**

**Instructions:** "Now it's your turn. You received the Testimony Development Worksheet last week. Let's refine your testimonies together using the STORY Framework."

**Step 1: Pair Up (5 minutes)**

* Break into pairs (leader with disciple, or disciple with disciple)  
* Each person shares which testimony they want to focus on tonight

**Step 2: Workshop in Pairs (20 minutes \- 10 min each person)**

* Person 1 shares their testimony draft out loud using their worksheet

* Person 2 listens and gives feedback:

  * "What part was most compelling?"

  * "Where could you add more specific details?"

  * "Is the STORY Framework clear? 

  * "Is God the hero of this story?"

* Person 1 makes notes on their worksheet

* Switch roles and repeat

**Leaders circulate during this time:**

* Ask clarifying questions

* Help disciples identify what's working and what needs refinement

* Encourage them: "This is powerful—don't be afraid to share the messy parts"

**Step 3: Volunteer Shares (10 minutes)**

* Ask them to share their refined testimony with the whole group

* After each testimony, the group gives feedback:

  * "What did you hear about God's character?"

  * "What made this testimony compelling?"

  * "How does this encourage your faith?"

**Affirm every testimony:** "This is what we're learning to do—see God's activity in our lives and tell others about it. You're becoming witnesses."

### **6\. Challenge & Commission (10 minutes)**

**This Week's Challenge:**

1. **Refine your testimony** \- Use the feedback you received tonight and polish your story

2. **Practice out loud** \- Share your testimony with someone outside this group (friend, family, coworker, stranger)

3. **Add to your worksheet** \- Write down any new "God moments" that happen this week

4. **Pray for opportunities** \- Ask God to open doors for you to share your testimony

**Next Week Preview:**

"Next week, we'll dive into Breaking Strongholds—identifying and overcoming lies that hold us back. Here's the thing—your testimonies tonight may have revealed some strongholds without you realizing it. Pay attention this week to any patterns or struggles that keep coming up. Keep building your library of testimonies."

### **7\. Closing Prayer & Declaration (5 minutes)**

**Leader prays:**

"Father, thank You for Your faithfulness in each of our lives. Thank You that every person in this room has a story to tell—a story of Your goodness, Your power, Your presence. Give us boldness to share our testimonies this week. Let our stories build faith in others and give You all the glory. In Jesus' name, Amen."

**Declare together:** 

"God is faithful. He is good. He is with us. And we will testify."

### 

### **Coaching Tips for Leaders**

### **Common Struggles:**

**"I don't have any big testimonies."** → "You don't need a dramatic story to have a powerful testimony. Even 'small' testimonies reveal God's character. Did He answer a prayer? Provide for a need? Give you peace in chaos? That's a testimony."

**"I'm not a good storyteller."** → "That's why we gave you the STORY Framework. Just follow the structure: Struggle, Turning Point, Outcome, Reflection, Your Invitation. It's like a roadmap—just fill in the details."

**"I don't want to sound preachy or religious."** → "Great instinct. The best testimonies are conversational and relatable. Tell your story like you're talking to a friend over coffee. Use normal language, not Christianese."

**"What if someone didn't complete their worksheet?"** → "That's okay. Use the workshop time to help them build their testimony from scratch. Ask guiding questions: 'When has God shown up in your life? What changed as a result?'"

**"Nothing happened this week—I don't have a new testimony."** → Dig deeper. Ask:

* "Did you pray about anything this week?"  
* "Did God speak to you through Scripture or another person?"  
* "Did He protect you from something you didn't even realize?"

**Someone's testimony is vague or generic ("God is just so good"):** → Ask follow-up questions:

* "Can you give me a specific example of when you experienced His goodness?"  
* "What happened that made you say that?"  
* "When did this happen? What did it look like?"

**Someone rambles and talks for 15+ minutes:**

* "I love this story. Let's pause here so everyone gets a chance to share. Can you give us the main point in one sentence?"

**Someone's "testimony" is actually complaining:**

* "I hear that was hard. Where did you see God in that situation?"  
* "What did you learn about Him through that?"

### **What to Watch For**

Good Signs:

* People are recognizing God in everyday life  
* Faith is increasing as they hear each other's stories  
* They're learning to tell their story clearly and compellingly  
* Gratitude is growing

Red Flags:

* Someone can't identify any testimony (possible spiritual dryness)  
* Testimonies are all about them, not God  
* No recent testimonies (they're not walking with God currently)

---

### **Leader Debrief (After the Meeting)**

* Who had powerful testimonies?  
* Who struggled to identify God's activity?  
* What patterns did we notice?  
* How can we help them see God more clearly?

Follow-Up:

* Text individual disciples mid-week: "Have you had a chance to share your testimony with anyone yet?"  
* Celebrate when someone shares their testimony—ask them how it went  
* Post in group chat: "Drop a 🙌 if you shared your testimony this week"  
* Continue adding your own answered prayers and "God moments" to model testimony-building

# **MONTH 2 COMPLETE**

## **Transition to Month 3: Breakthrough**

## **What You Just Accomplished**

**Month 2 was transformational.** Your disciples:

* ✅ **Asked hard questions** and found answers (Week 5: Q\&A Deep Dive)

* ✅ **Heard God for others** and activated the prophetic (Week 6: Listening Prayer Circle)

* ✅ **Went on mission** and applied faith in the real world (Week 7: Outreach)

* ✅ **Built powerful testimonies** and processed God's activity (Week 8: Testimony Time)

**They're no longer just learning—they're DOING.**

---

### **What Changed in Month 2**

**Vulnerability Increased:** Disciples moved from surface-level sharing to authentic, gut-level honesty. Trust deepened. Walls came down.

**Ministry to One Another:** Disciples began praying for each other, encouraging one another, and hearing God for one another. They're not just receiving—they're giving.

**Faith in Action:** The outreach experience pushed everyone outside their comfort zones. They saw God show up in real-time. Fresh testimonies were born.

**Ownership Growing:** Disciples are taking more responsibility for their spiritual growth. They're not waiting for you to prompt them—they're initiating.

**This is exactly what Phase 1 is supposed to look like.**

## 

## **Evaluation: Are They Ready for Month 3?**

### **Green Lights (Ready for Month 3):**

* ✅ Consistent attendance (80%+ of meetings)  
* ✅ Engaging in group chat and communication  
* ✅ Demonstrating vulnerability and trust  
* ✅ Practicing daily habits (3D Journal, 4D Prayer)  
* ✅ Stepping out in faith (prayer, evangelism, prophecy)  
* ✅ Showing spiritual curiosity (asking questions, seeking growth)

**If most of these are true, proceed to Month 3\.**

### **Yellow Lights (Proceed with Caution):**

* ⚠️ Spotty attendance (60-80% of meetings)  
* ⚠️ Surface-level vulnerability (still guarded)  
* ⚠️ Inconsistent daily habits (journaling/praying 3-4 days/week)  
* ⚠️ Passive engagement (not initiating, only responding)

**If you see these signs:**

* Address them directly: "I've noticed \[pattern\]. Can we talk about what's holding you back?"  
* Consider extending Month 2 by 2-4 weeks before moving to Month 3  
* Focus on the specific gaps (attendance, habits, vulnerability, etc.)

### **Red Lights (Not Ready—Reset Expectations):**

* 🚨 Regular absences (\<60% attendance)  
* 🚨 No vulnerability (still wearing masks)  
* 🚨 Not doing daily habits (0-2 days/week journaling/praying)  
* 🚨 Apathy or disengagement (passive, unresponsive, checked out)  
* 🚨 Unwilling to step out in faith (refused outreach, won't pray for others)

**If you see these signs:**

* Have a direct conversation: "I'm noticing you're not fully engaged. What's going on?"  
* Revisit expectations: "Are you still committed to this DNA group?"  
* Give them a choice: Recommit or gracefully exit  
* **Don't drag uncommitted disciples into Month 3\.** It's unfair to them and the group.

**Better to reset now than to limp through the next 4 weeks.**

### 

### **Prepare for Month 3: Breakthrough (Weeks 9-12)**

**Month 3 Focus:** Addressing Root Issues, Breaking Strongholds, Activating Identity & Gifts

**What's Coming:**

* Week 9: Breaking Strongholds (Reveal, Renounce, Replace)  
* Week 10: Identity Activation Workshop (Who you are in Christ)  
* Week 11: Spiritual Gifts Discovery & Activation (How God wired you)  
* Week 12: Life Assessment Revisited (Measuring growth, setting new goals)

**What Changes in Month 3:**

* **Deeper deliverance ministry** (addressing lies, strongholds, agreements with the enemy)  
* **Identity-focused teaching** (building up who they are in Christ)  
* **Gifting activation** (discovering and using their spiritual gifts)  
* **Preparation for Phase 2** (assessing readiness for co-leadership)

**Month 3 is where breakthroughs happen.**

Expect tears. Expect freedom. Expect revelation. Expect spiritual warfare.

**This is where disciples step into their true identity and calling.**

---

### **Leader Prep for Month 3**

**Spiritual Preparation:**

* **Pray for breakthrough** over each disciple by name  
* **Fast if led** (stronghold-breaking requires spiritual authority)  
* **Expect spiritual warfare** (the enemy doesn't like people getting free)

**Practical Preparation:**

* Review Week 9 Strongholds Workshop format  
* Prepare to facilitate deliverance ministry (it's simpler than you think)  
* Have tissues ready (Week 9-10 often bring tears)  
* Plan for extra time if needed (some breakthroughs can't be rushed)

**Mindset Shift:**

* **You're not just teaching—you're facilitating encounters with God**  
* **Let the Holy Spirit lead—don't force breakthrough**  
* **Celebrate small wins—every lie exposed is a victory**

---

## **Final Encouragement Before Month 3**

**You've laid an incredible foundation.**

Your disciples now have:

* Tools they'll use for the rest of their lives (3D, 4D, Creed Cards)  
* Experience hearing God (individually and corporately)  
* Testimonies of God's faithfulness (from outreach and everyday life)  
* A safe community where they can be vulnerable

**Month 3 builds on all of this.**

You're about to see disciples:

* Break free from lies they've believed for years  
* Step into their true identity in Christ  
* Discover how God has uniquely wired them  
* Prepare to lead others (Phase 2 readiness)

**This is the moment you've been building toward.**

### **Month 3 Starts Now.**
