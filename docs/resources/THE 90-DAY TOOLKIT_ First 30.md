# **THE 90-DAY TOOLKIT**

## **Month 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**

## 

## 

## 

*A discipleship resource from ARK Identity*

# ***app.arkidentity.com***

## **First 30 Days\!**

You're about to begin the most transformational 4 weeks of your disciples' lives. This month lays the foundation for everything that follows—not just in the next 12 weeks, but for a lifetime of discipleship.

**Establishing a foundation of..** 

* **Trust** between you and your disciples  
* **Core DNA tools** that they'll use daily for the rest of their lives  
* **Safety** to be vulnerable without judgment  
* **Rhythms** of consistent spiritual habits

By the end of Week 4, your disciples should:

* ✅ Know where they're starting from (Life Assessment)  
* ✅ Be practicing 3D Journal daily  
* ✅ Be practicing 4D Prayer daily  
* ✅ Understand core theological foundations (Creed Cards)  
* ✅ Feel safe to be real and vulnerable

## **The 4-Week Structure**

| Week | Tool | Core Focus | Time Commitment |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Week 1** | **Life Assessment** | Understanding where we are | 90 min meeting |
| **Week 2** | **3D Journal** | Hearing God through Scripture | 90 min meeting \+ 10 min daily |
| **Week 3** | **4D Prayer Rhythm** | Establishing daily prayer | 90 min meeting \+ 10 min daily |
| **Week 4** | **Creed Cards** | Building theological foundation | 90 min meeting \+ daily review |

**Total Daily Time Commitment (Weeks 2-4):** **3D Journal:** 10-15 minutes **4D Prayer:** 10-15 minutes

## **Critical Success Factors for Month 1**

### **1\. Consistency**

Disciples must attend all 4 weeks. If someone misses Week 2 or 3, they'll miss the daily habit training and fall behind.

### **2\. Modeling**

Leaders must go first in vulnerability and daily habits. If you're not journaling daily, don't expect your disciples to.

### **3\. Safety**

Create a judgment-free zone. Disciples will only be vulnerable if they feel safe.

### **4\. Follow-Up**

Check in between meetings. Encourage daily habits. Celebrate small wins.

## **What to Watch For This Month**

### **Green Lights (Good Signs):**

* Disciples showing up on time consistently  
* Increasing vulnerability in sharing  
* Posting confirmation of 3D Journal and 4D Prayer in group chat  
* Asking thoughtful questions  
* Engagement between meetings

### **Red Flags (Address These):**

* Missing meetings or showing up late repeatedly  
* Surface-level sharing (no vulnerability)  
* Not posting daily habits in group chat  
* Passive participation (just observing, not engaging)  
* Defensiveness when challenged

**If you see red flags:** Address them privately and immediately. Don't wait until Week 5\.

# 

## **Week 1:** 

# **Life Assessment**

## **Understanding Where We Are**

### **Purpose**

To establish a baseline understanding of each person's spiritual, emotional, and relational health. This creates a roadmap for growth and helps leaders discern where to focus their discipleship efforts.

### **Why This Matters**

You can't grow what you don't measure. Life Assessment helps disciples become self-aware and gives leaders insight into hidden struggles, false beliefs, and areas needing attention.

**Preparation (DNA Leader \- Before Week 1\)**

**CRITICAL: You must have DNA Groups Dashboard access before Week 1**

1. **Confirm Dashboard Access**  
   * Log in to the DNA Groups Dashboard  
   * Verify you can see your group and disciples  
   * If you cannot log in, contact your church leader or ARK Identity immediately  
2. **Send Assessment Links**  
   * From your dashboard, send the Week 1 Life Assessment link to each disciple  
   * You can send this 1-2 days before the meeting OR right as the meeting starts  
   * **Important:** Disciples will complete this LIVE during the meeting, not beforehand  
3. **Review Assessment Categories**  
   * Familiarize yourself with the 7 categories (see below)  
   * This helps you guide discussion after they complete it

**What You'll Need:**

* Wifi access for disciples to complete online assessment  
* Your phone/tablet to monitor assessment completion in dashboard

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

1. ### **Welcome & Opening (10 minutes)**

* Open with prayer, inviting the Holy Spirit into the space

* Cast vision: "Tonight is about getting real. No performance, no pretending. We're creating a safe place to grow."

* Share group agreements (if first meeting)

2. ### **Assessment Completion (20 \- 30 minutes)**

   **Send the Link:**

1. If you haven't already, send the Week 1 Life Assessment link from your DNA Groups Dashboard now  
2. Have disciples check their email/text and click the link  
3. They'll be prompted to confirm their name and start the assessment  
   **While They Complete:**

* Sit quietly and pray for each disciple  
* Avoid monitoring their answers—this creates trust  
* Be available if someone has a technical question  
* Monitor your dashboard to see when everyone has submitted  
  **Troubleshooting:**

* If someone didn't receive the link, resend from dashboard  
* If wifi is weak, consider mobile hotspot or rescheduling  
* If someone finishes early, encourage them to review their answers prayerfully

### **3\. Sharing & Discussion (40 minutes)**

* Go around the circle—each person shares 3-5 answers

* Leaders go first to model vulnerability

* Ask follow-up questions:

  * "Why did you answer that way?"

  * "Where do you think that belief came from?"

  * "What would you like to see change?"


  **What to listen for:**

* Lies they believe about God, themselves, or others

* Patterns of fear, shame, or insecurity

* Areas where they lack biblical foundation

* Evidence of spiritual hunger or apathy

### **4\. Closing Prayer (10 minutes)**

* Pray over each person by name

* Ask God to begin revealing truth and healing wounds

* Thank God for the courage to be honest

### 

## **Life Assessment: What it measures**

The Life Assessment covers **7 key areas of discipleship health**. 

Disciples rate themselves on a 1-5 scale and answer reflection questions in each category.

**The 7 Categories:**

1. **Relationship with God**  
   * Daily time with God, prayer life, worship, Bible engagement  
   * Sensing God's presence, hearing His voice  
2. **Spiritual Freedom**  
   * Freedom from sin patterns, shame, guilt, spiritual oppression  
   * Breaking ungodly cycles, experiencing God's grace  
3. **Identity & Emotions**  
   * Understanding identity in Christ vs. performance-based identity  
   * Emotional health, managing stress, self-awareness  
4. **Relationships**  
   * Quality of key relationships (family, friends, church community)  
   * Conflict resolution, forgiveness, healthy boundaries  
5. **Calling & Purpose**  
   * Clarity on life calling, spiritual gifts, kingdom contribution  
   * Alignment between values and daily choices  
6. **Lifestyle & Stewardship**  
   * Management of time, finances, physical health  
   * Sabbath rhythms, rest, work-life balance  
7. **Spiritual Fruit**  
   * Evidence of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control  
   * Character transformation over time

**Assessment Structure:**

* 42 total questions (6 per category)  
* Mix of 1-5 rating scale questions and open-ended reflections  
* Takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete  
* Disciples submit online; leaders receive instant results in dashboard

### **After the Meeting (Leader debrief)**

1. **Review Results in Dashboard**

   * Log in to your DNA Groups Dashboard  
   * Review each disciple's assessment summary  
   * Note any red flags (severe struggles, crisis language)  
   * Do NOT share individual results with others without permission

**Leaders and co-leaders should debrief immediately after:**

* What stood out to you about each person?  
  * What lies or patterns did you notice?  
  * Where do we need to focus our energy?  
  * What strongholds need to be addressed?  
  * Are there any red flags we need to watch?

2. **Follow Up Individually (If Needed)**

   * If someone's assessment revealed crisis-level issues (suicidal thoughts, abuse, severe depression), reach out within 24 hours  
   * Offer to pray with them, connect them to a counselor, or involve a pastor  
   * Keep it confidential

**Action Steps:**

* Text each disciple a word of encouragement within 24 hours  
* Begin praying specifically for what was revealed  
* Make notes in a journal for future reference

# 

# **Week 2:** 

# **The 3D Journal**

## **Learning to Hear God Through Scripture**

### 

### **Purpose**

To establish a **daily habit** of encountering God through Scripture using the 3D Journal method. This isn't just teaching a tool—it's launching a lifestyle of hearing God's voice daily that will sustain disciples for the rest of their lives.

### **Why This Matters**

Most Christians struggle with Bible reading because they don't know how to move from information to transformation. The 3D Journal bridges that gap. When disciples commit to journaling daily, they develop spiritual muscle memory—recognizing God's voice, applying truth personally, and walking in obedience. **A disciple who journals daily for a year will be unrecognizable from who they are today.**

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

Leaders:

* Use Today’s Scripture in the ARK app or pick a passage that you want your disciples to use.  
* Complete your own 3D beforehand so you can model it  
* Use the ARK app or bring paper for disciples to use.

Disciples:

* Make sure you are logged in to the ARK app. [app.arkidentity.com](http://app.arkidentity.com) (this ensures your journal entries will be saved)

## 

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening & Check-In (15 minutes)**

* How was your week?  
* Brief prayer

### **2\. Teach the 3D Journal Method and Time to Write (20 minutes)**

**Scripture:** Write out the verse(s) that stood out to you. What jumped off the page?

**1D: HEAD** \- What do you notice about this passage? What's the context? Who's speaking? What's happening? What does this reveal about God's character?

**2D: HEART** \- What is God saying to YOU right now in this moment through this scripture? How does this apply to your life right now? 

**3D: HANDS** \- “God, what do you want me to do with this? What action do you want me to take after receiving this from you? 

### **Example: (Using Hebrews 4:14-16)**

**S:** “Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.” \- Hebrews 4:14-16

**1D (HEAD):** How could we be ashamed to approach the Father after knowing we have Jesus as our representative. He has made a way for us to be reconciled back to the Father. This should cause us to run to God and ask for help at any moment whether good or bad.

**2D (HEART):** God is saying " Do you trust that my blood was more than enough to cover your sin? You must believe this to receive the right of throne room access. By faith, step into pure sonship. You are welcome here, come often and confidently.

**3D (HANDS):** I will not apologize for asking God for help in all situations. It is my right as an adopted son of God. I will be bolder in my prayers. Ask Big\!

### **3\. Share 3D Journal Insights (20 minutes)**

* Each person shares their 3D Journal entry (3-5 minutes each)  
* Leaders go first to model  
* After each person shares, the group responds:  
  * "What stood out to you about what they shared?"  
  * "What did you hear God saying to them?"  
  * Leaders give gentle feedback if interpretation is off

**What to listen for:**

* Are they actually hearing from God or just regurgitating theology?  
* Are they applying it personally (2D) or keeping it abstract?  
* Are they praying with specificity (3D) or staying generic?  
* Did they engage all three dimensions or skip straight to application?

### **4\. The Daily Habit Challenge (10 minutes)**

**Shift the conversation from tool to lifestyle:**

"We just showed you HOW to do a 3D Journal. But here's the real question: What would change in your life if you did this every single day for the next year?"

*(Let them respond. Don't rush this. Let it sink in.)*

**Imagine this:** 365 days from now, you've journaled through Scripture every single day. That's 365 conversations with God. 365 times you've heard His voice. 365 applications you've made to your life.

**What would be different?**

* You'd know the Bible intimately, not just casually  
* You'd recognize God's voice instantly  
* You'd have a record of God's faithfulness to look back on  
* You'd have clarity on decisions because you're hearing Him daily  
* You'd be able to teach others because you've processed Scripture yourself

**The Reality:**

"Most Christians read their Bible occasionally. Maybe on Sundays. Maybe when they're in crisis. But disciples who multiply? They have a daily rhythm of hearing from God. The 3D Journal is that rhythm."

**The Commitment:**

"So here's what we're asking: Will you commit to 3D journaling every day for the next 30 days?"

*(Pause. Let them verbally commit or voice hesitation.)*

**Address Hesitation:** If someone says, "I don't know if I can do that every day,"

**Respond:** "Let's be honest—how much time do you spend on your phone daily? Scrolling social media? Watching shows? This is 10-15 minutes. If you can scroll Instagram for 20 minutes, you can journal for 10\. This isn't about adding more to your plate—it's about prioritizing what matters most."

**Make It Practical:** "When will you do it? Morning? Night? Lunch break? Pick a specific time right now and write it down." *(Have them actually write it down or say it out loud.)*

### **5\. Prayer Activation (15 minutes)**

* Pray for one another based on what each of you shared  
* Pray for discipline and consistency to continue studying His word in this way

### **6\. 3D Bible Challenge (10 minutes)**

**Show them how to sign up for a 3D Bible Challenge on the app. (7, 21, or 50 Days)**

1. **Use Daily Group Chat Check-In**  
   * Every day for the length of the challenge, drop a screenshot of your 3D Journal in the group chat  
   * You don't have to write a novel—could be one sentence per box.  
   * Seeing others post will keep you motivated  
2. **Weekly Progress Check**  
   * At the start of each DNA meeting, we'll go around: 'How has journaling helped you connect with God this week?'  
   * No shame if you miss—just honest accountability  
3. **Leaders Model First**  
   * We'll post our 3D Journals in the group chat this week to show you what it looks like  
   * You'll see us doing this daily—we're not asking you to do something we're not doing

**Remove Barriers:** "What's going to make this hard for you?" *(Let them voice obstacles: time, confusion, forgetfulness, etc.)*

**Problem-Solve Together:**

* **"I forget"** → Set a daily phone reminder  
* **"I don't know what to read"** → Use "Today's Scripture" in the ARK app  
* **"I'm too busy"** → What can you cut? What's less important than hearing from God?  
* **"I don't understand the Bible well enough"** → That's exactly WHY you journal—understanding grows with practice

**What’s the goal?**

Our goal isn't perfection—it's consistency. If you journal 6 out of 7 days this week, that's a win. By Week 4, we want you at 7 out of 7\. By Week 8, this should be as automatic as brushing your teeth.

### **3D Journal Coaching Tips**

**Problem:** 1D (HEAD) is just a restatement of the verse  
**Solution:** "Go deeper. What's the context? What does this reveal about God? Why did the author write this?"

**Problem:** 2D (HEART) is generic ("I should pray more")  
**Solution:** "Get specific. What does this look like TODAY in your life? What actual step will you take?"

**Problem:** 3D (HANDS) is one sentence  
**Solution:** "Talk to God like He's in the room with you. Be honest. Ask for help. Commit to action."

**Problem:** They skip 1D (HEAD) and jump straight to application  
**Solution:** "Let's slow down. Before we apply it, we need to understand what it actually says. What's God revealing about Himself here?"

**Problem:** Their 2D (HEART) doesn't connect to the passage  
**Solution:** "I love your honesty, but how does THIS passage speak to that? Let's make sure we're letting Scripture guide our application, not just our current feelings."

### 

### **Leader Debrief (After the Meeting)**

* Who grasped the method quickly?  
* Who struggled? What part was hardest for them—HEAD, HEART, or HANDS?  
* Did anyone share something theologically off? How do we address it?  
* Are they excited about this tool or overwhelmed?  
* Did anyone skip a dimension (especially 1D or 3D)?

**Follow-Up:**

* Text disciples mid-week: "How's your 3D journaling going?"  
* Share your own 3D Journal entry in the group chat as encouragement

# **Week 3:** 

# **4D Prayer**

## **Revere, Reflect, Request, Rest**

### **Purpose**

Establish a daily prayer rhythm using the 4D framework (Revere, Reflect, Request, Rest) and activate disciples as intercessors who stand in the gap for others.

### **Why This Matters**

Prayer isn't just asking God for things—it's partnering with Him in what He's already doing. Jesus stands in the gap for us; because we're in Him, we stand in the gap for others. The 4D Prayer Rhythm makes this a sustainable daily practice.

## **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

**Leaders:**

* Set up your own "In The Gap" prayer cards in the ARK app  
* Test the prayer session flow so you can guide confidently  
* Prepare to teach Ezekiel 22:30 and Hebrews 7:25  
* Have your device ready to screen share (if using projector/TV)  
* Bring Bluetooth speaker if available (for shared music)

**Disciples:**

* Have ARK app open on phone or computer (app.arkidentity.com)  
* No other preparation needed

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening: The Theology of "In The Gap" (20 minutes)**

*"I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one."*  
 **— Ezekiel 22:30 NASB**

**Ask:** "What does it mean to 'stand in the gap'?"

*(Let them respond, then teach:)*

**Standing in the gap \= Intercessory prayer**

* It's standing between God and people  
* It's pleading on behalf of those who can't (or won't) pray for themselves  
* It's partnering with God's heart for the lost, broken, and hurting

**Jesus is THE Gap-Stander:**

*"Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them."*  
 **— Hebrews 7:25 NASB**

Jesus is ALWAYS interceding for us. Right now. This moment. He never stops.

**Because we're IN CHRIST, we participate in His intercessory work:**

*"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession..."*  
 **— 1 Peter 2:9 NASB**

You are a priest. Intercession isn't optional—it's your identity.

**The 4D Prayer Rhythm:**

"Today we're introducing a tool that makes daily intercession simple, sustainable, and powerful. It's called the **4D Prayer Rhythm**, and it happens in a feature of the ARK app called **'In The Gap.'**

The rhythm has 4 movements:

1. **REVERE** — Worship God for who He is  
2. **REFLECT** — Thank God for what He's done  
3. **REQUEST** — Intercede for others  
4. **REST** — Listen to what God is saying

This isn't just for beginners—it's a lifestyle. A rhythm of relationship. You'll do this daily, just like your 3D Journal."

---

### **2\. Create Prayer Cards Together (20 minutes)**

In The Gap isn't just a prayer session—it's a prayer room. When you open the ARK app and go to the **Prayer** tab, you'll enter 'In The Gap.'

The first thing you'll do is create **prayer cards**—these are the people and situations you're standing in the gap for. Creating these cards is a prayerful act. Don't rush it.

**Live Demo (Leaders screen share or walk through together):**

1. Open ARK app → Click **Prayer** tab  
2. You'll see the entry to **"In The Gap"**  
3. Click **Create Prayer Card**  
4. Fill in:  
   * Name of person/situation  
   * Specific request (be detailed—not "bless them" but "breakthrough in marriage")  
   * Optional: Scripture to pray over them  
   * Optional: Photo

**Categories to Create (5-10 cards total):**

* **DNA Group:** One card per person in your group  
* **Family:** Parents, spouse, kids, siblings  
* **Lost Friends/Coworkers:** 2-3 people who need Jesus  
* **City/Nation:** Your city \+ one nation on your heart

**Give them 15 minutes to create cards:**

* Leaders walk around and help  
* Play soft instrumental music in the background (sets the tone)  
* Remind them: "This is worship. You're building an altar of intercession."

---

### **3\. Shared Prayer Session (25 minutes)**

**Setup:**

* Everyone has their prayer cards ready  
* Leaders connect device to Bluetooth speaker (for shared music)  
* Everyone else mutes music on their own device  
* We'll start a prayer session together—everyone looks at their own screen

**How the session works:**

"When you start a prayer session, the app will guide you through the 4D rhythm with text prompts on the screen. Instrumental music will play. Your prayer cards will appear one at a time during the REQUEST section.

We're going to do this together for 20 minutes. I'll pray out loud to set the atmosphere—feel free to join in and pray your own prayers out loud as we go."

**Start the session simultaneously:**

---

**REVERE (Awe and honor for who God is)**

* Screen shows prompts: "Who is God to you today?"  
* Music plays softly  
* **Leaders pray out loud first:** "God, You are faithful. You are mighty. You are near."  
* Disciples join in, praying out loud or silently

---

**REFLECT (Honesty and gratitude before God)**

* Screen shows prompts: "What has God done for you recently?"  
* Music continues  
* **Leaders share gratitude out loud:** "Thank You for providing this week. Thank You for healing my friend."  
* Disciples join in

---

**REQUEST (Be bold to ask big for everything and everyone)**

* Screen shows prayer cards **one at a time**  
* Music continues  
* **Leaders pray their cards out loud:** "God, I pray for Sarah. I ask for breakthrough in her marriage. I pray Ephesians 3:20 over her—do more than she can ask or imagine."  
* Disciples see their own cards on their screens and pray out loud or silently

---

**REST (Be still in God’s presence listening for His voice)**

* Screen shows prompts: "Be still. Listen. What is God saying?"  
* Music plays softly—no one speaks  
* Let God speak

---

**Debrief (5 minutes):**

"How was that experience?"

*(Let them respond. Ask follow-up questions:)*

* "What did you notice during REST?"  
* "Did praying out loud feel awkward or helpful?"  
* "Can you see yourself doing this daily?"

**Affirm:**

"What you just experienced is what you'll do every day. Some days you'll pray out loud (if you're alone). Some days you'll pray silently (if you're in public or at work). The rhythm stays the same."

---

### **4\. Daily Habit Challenge (15 minutes)**

**The Two-Habit Rhythm:**

"You've now learned two core habits:

* **Week 2:** 3D Journal (hearing God through Scripture)  
* **Week 3:** 4D Prayer (hearing God through prayer)

Here's what we're asking: **Do both daily for the next 7 days.**

**Morning:** 3D Journal (10 minutes)  
**Anytime:** In The Gap prayer session (10 minutes)  
**Total:** 20 minutes a day with God

If you do these two things consistently, you WILL grow. It's not complicated—it's just consistent."

#### **Managing Your Prayer Cards:**

"Throughout the week:

* **Add new prayer cards** as God brings people to mind  
* **When God answers a prayer,** go back into the app, mark it as answered, and leave a testimony  
* **Next week (Week 5),** we'll share testimonies—check your answered prayers before then"

**Accountability:**

"Every day this week, drop a checkmark in the group chat:  
 ✓ Journaled \+ Prayed today

Leaders will post first every day to model. We're not trying to shame anyone—we're creating momentum."

### **5\. Closing Prayer (10 minutes)**

#### **Leader prays over the group:**

"Father, thank You for calling us to stand in the gap. Thank You that Jesus is ALWAYS interceding for us, and because we're in Him, we get to participate. Help us be faithful in these two daily habits—journaling and praying. Let this become as natural as breathing. Train our ears to hear Your voice. In Jesus' name, Amen."

### **Between Meetings: Follow-Up Actions**

**Leaders:**

* Post daily in group chat: "✓ Journaled \+ Prayed today"  
* Text individual disciples mid-week: "How's the daily rhythm going?"  
* Celebrate when someone posts a testimony of answered prayer

**Disciples:**

* Journal daily (3D)  
* Pray daily (4D)  
* Add new prayer cards as needed  
* Mark answered prayers and leave testimonies

## **Coaching Tips for Leaders**

### **Common Struggles:**

**"I don't have a smartphone."**  
 → "The app works on any computer at app.arkidentity.com. Or you can use a notepad—write out the 4 movements and your prayer list. The app just makes it easier."

**"I forgot to pray some days."**  
 → "That's okay—just restart tomorrow. We're building a habit, not earning God's love."

**"I felt awkward praying out loud."**  
 → "It gets easier. Start by praying silently, then whisper, then speak. You'll grow into it."

**"I don't know what to pray for some people."**  
 → "Ask God. Say, 'God, what do YOU want for this person?' He'll give you words."

### **What to Watch For:**

**Good Signs:**

* Disciples creating detailed, specific prayer cards  
* Praying out loud during the session (even if quietly)  
* Asking questions about how to pray for certain situations  
* Excited about the daily rhythm

**Red Flags:**

* Vague, generic prayer cards ("bless them")  
* Silent during entire REQUEST time (fear or disengagement)  
* Skipping the daily habit (check in privately—what's the barrier?)

# 

### **Week 4:** 

# **Foundation Doctrines**

## **(Creed Cards)**

## **Building on Historic Christian Truth**

### **Purpose**

Introduce disciples to the Creed Card tool as a way to build theological foundation through interactive discovery and discussion. This week launches an ongoing practice of wrestling with essential Christian beliefs.

### **Why This Matters**

You can't build a house without a foundation. Creed Cards give us bite-sized, biblical truths rooted in 2,000 years of Christian history. These aren't optional beliefs—they're essentials that define what it means to follow Jesus.

### **Preparation (Before the Meeting)**

**Leaders:**

* Access Creed Cards in the ARK Identity app

* Select 2-3 cards for tonight (see suggestions below)

* Have devices ready to display cards OR print front/back for each person

* Review the "flip methodology" so you can model it

* Prepare to explain what a creed is (see below)

**Disciples:**

* No preparation needed

## **Meeting Structure (90 minutes)**

### **1\. Opening: What Is a Creed? (10 minutes)**

"When you hear the word 'creed,' what comes to mind?"

*(Let them respond. Most won't know.)*

**Define it:** "A creed is a statement of belief. The word comes from the Latin *credo*, which means 'I believe.' Throughout Christian history, the church has used creeds to say, 'These are the non-negotiables. These are the truths we stand on together.'"

* **The Apostles' Creed** (summarizes the gospel)

* **The Nicene Creed** (clarifies who Jesus is)

* **The five Solas of the Reformation** (grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone, Scripture alone, glory to God alone)

**Why creeds matter:**

1. **They protect us from false teaching**

   * When someone twists Scripture, creeds help us spot it

   * "That doesn't line up with what the church has believed for 2,000 years"

2. **They unite us across time and space**

   * Christians in Kenya, China, and Iowa believe the same core truths

   * We're part of a 2,000-year-old family

3. **They give us language to articulate our faith**

   * You can't defend what you can't define

   * "Always be prepared to give an answer for the hope that you have" (1 Peter 3:15)

**Introduce Creed Cards:** 

"Creed Cards are a tool to help you learn and wrestle with these foundational truths. Each card focuses on one essential doctrine—one core belief rooted in Scripture and church history."

### 

### **2\. How to Use Creed Cards (10 minutes)            ARK app: [app.arkidentity.com](http://app.arkidentity.com)**

### **Step 1: DISCUSS (Before Flipping)**

* Look at the front: the topic, Greek/Hebrew word, transliteration  
* **Ask:** "What does this word mean to you?"  
* Let everyone share what they think BEFORE seeing the definition  
* This surfaces assumptions, confusion, and different perspectives

### **Step 2: DEFINE**

* Flip the card and read the definition together  
* Read the key Scripture  
* Read the historical context

### **Step 3: DEEPEN**

* Compare what you thought vs. what Scripture says  
* Ask: "Does this align with what you believed? What surprises you?"  
* Read the key Scripture in context (look up the passage, read surrounding verses)  
* Find OTHER Scriptures that use the same word or concept

### **Step 4: DISCUSS**

* Answer the reflection question on the card  
* "How does this truth change the way you live?"

### **Step 5: DO IT AGAIN**

* Creed Cards aren't one-and-done  
* Come back to them regularly  
* Memorize the key Scripture  
* Review in the app throughout the week

## **3\. Work Through 2-3 Creed Cards (60 minutes) Suggested Starter Cards:**

1. **Faith** (Trusting in Christ Alone \- *pistis*)  
2. **Gospel** (Good News of Jesus)  
3. **Grace** (Unmerited Favor \- *charis*) *(Optional if time allows)*

### 

### **EXAMPLE CARD 1: Faith (*pistis*) \- 20-25 minutes**

#### **Step 1: DISCUSS (Before Flipping) \- 5 minutes**

**Ask:** "Before we look at the definition, what does **faith** mean to you?"

*(Let them share. Don't correct yet—just listen.)*

**Follow-up:** "The subtitle says 'trusting in Christ alone.' What does that phrase mean?"

#### **Step 2: READ (After Flipping) \- 3 minutes**

**Definition:** "Faith is trusting in Jesus Christ for our salvation. It is not mere intellectual agreement, but confident reliance on Him. True faith results in transformation and obedience."

**Key Scripture:** "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." — Romans 5:1 NASB

**Historical Context:** 

"The Reformers emphasized *sola fide* (faith alone)—we are saved by faith in Christ, not by our works. This was central to the Protestant Reformation."

### **Step 3: DEEPEN \- 10 minutes**

**Compare:** "How does this definition compare to what you said earlier?"

**Dig into Scripture:**

* "Let's look up Romans 5:1 and read verses 1-5 together."  
* "What does Paul mean by 'justified by faith'?"

**Word Study:**

* "The Greek word *pistis* means faith, trust, belief."  
* "Let's find another verse that uses this word."

**Examples:**

* John 3:16: "whoever believes (*pisteuō* \- related to *pistis*) in Him"  
* Ephesians 2:8-9: "by grace you have been saved through faith"  
* Hebrews 11:1: "faith is the assurance of things hoped for"

**Ask:**

* "Why is it important that faith is more than just intellectual agreement?"  
* "What's the difference between believing Jesus EXISTS vs. trusting Him with your life?"

### **Step 4: Discuss \- 5 minutes**

**Reflection Question (on the card):** "What does it look like for you to trust Christ completely rather than relying on your own efforts?"

*(Give everyone 2-3 minutes to share their answer.)*

### 

### 

### **CARD 2: Gospel \- 20-25 minutes**

*(Repeat the same 4-step process)*

#### **Step 1: DISCUSS (Before Flipping)**

* Front: **Gospel** \- *Good News* \- εὐαγγέλιον (*euangelion*)  
* "What is the gospel? How would you explain it to someone?"

  #### **Step 2: READ (After Flipping)**

* Definition, Key Scripture (1 Cor 15:3-4), Historical Context

  #### **Step 3: DEEPEN**

* Read 1 Corinthians 15:1-8 in context  
* Find other "gospel" verses (Romans 1:16, Mark 1:15)  
* "Why is the resurrection essential to the gospel?"

  #### **Step 4: REFLECT**

* "How would you explain the gospel to a 10-year-old? To a skeptic?"

### **Optional CARD 3: Grace (charis) \- 15 minutes if time allows**

*(Same process, but move faster since they now understand the method)*

## **4\. Set Up Ongoing Practice (5 minutes)**

**Moving forward:**

* "We'll work through one Creed Card every 2-3 weeks"  
* "Between now and next meeting, review tonight's cards in the app"  
* "Memorize the key Scripture from the **Faith** card (Romans 5:1)"

**Challenge them:**

* "This week, explain the gospel to someone outside this group using what we learned tonight"  
* "Open the ARK app and read through 2 more Creed Cards on your own"

## **5\. Closing Prayer (5 minutes)**

Have one of your disciples pray out. They need to begin to practice this.

## **Creed Card Coaching Tips**

### **Common Questions/Responses:**

**"I was taught differently in my church."** → "That's okay. Let's look at Scripture together and see what it says. We're not here to bash other beliefs—we're here to discover truth."

**"This seems too complicated."** → "It's okay if you don't understand everything tonight. That's why we return to these cards multiple times. Let it sink in slowly."

**"Why do we need to know Greek/Hebrew words?"** → "Because English translations can sometimes miss nuances. Knowing the original word helps us understand what the authors meant."

**Someone shares a false belief:** → Don't shame them. Say: "I appreciate your honesty. Let's see what Scripture says and compare."

**"How do I know which Creed Cards to study?"** → "Start with the essentials: Faith, Gospel, Grace, Identity, Trinity, Holy Spirit. Then branch out based on questions that come up."

## 

## **After the Meeting**

**Follow-Up:**

* Text the group: "Which Creed Card challenged you most tonight?"  
* Send a screenshot or link to the 2-3 cards you covered  
* Remind them to review in the app this week

## **Congratulations\! You've Completed Month 1**

**Your disciples have now:**

* ✅ Completed a Life Assessment (baseline established)  
* ✅ Learned the 3D Journal method  
* ✅ Learned the 4D Prayer Rhythm  
* ✅ Explored core doctrines through Creed Cards  
* ✅ Established daily spiritual habits (3D \+ 4D \= 20-30 min/day)

## **Month 1 Evaluation**

Before moving to Month 2, evaluate each disciple:

### **Green Lights (Ready for Month 2):**

* \[ \] Attended all 4 weeks consistently  
* \[ \] Posting 3D Journal and 4D Prayer in group chat daily (or most days)  
* \[ \] Engaged in discussions (not just observing)  
* \[ \] Showing increasing vulnerability  
* \[ \] Asking thoughtful questions  
* \[ \] Teachable spirit (receives feedback well)

### **Red Flags (Address Before Month 2):**

* \[ \] Missed 2+ meetings  
* \[ \] Not practicing daily habits (no posts in group chat)  
* \[ \] Still surface-level in sharing  
* \[ \] Defensive when challenged  
* \[ \] Passive participation

**If you see red flags:** Address them individually before Week 5\. Have a direct conversation:

"I've noticed \[specific behavior\]. Help me understand what's going on. Are you still committed to this? What do you need from us?"

**Don't move forward if disciples aren't engaged.** Better to extend Month 1 or reset expectations than to drag uncommitted disciples into Month 2\.

## **Prepare for Month 2: Deepening (Weeks 5-8)**

**Month 2 Focus:** Vulnerability, Ownership, Ministry to One Another

**Tools:**

* Week 5: Q\&A Deep Dive  
* Week 6: Listening Prayer Circle  
* Week 7: Outreach/Mission Activity  
* Week 8: Testimony Time/Mission Debrief

**What Changes:**

* Disciples should be leading devotionals  
* More time for testimony and hearing God  
* First outreach experience

**Leader Prep:**

* Continue modeling daily habits  
* Increase delegation (let disciples lead more)  
* Plan the Week 8 outreach activity

## **Final Encouragement**

**You did it.** You led your disciples through the foundation. They now have tools they'll use for the rest of their lives.

**The daily habits are the game-changer.** If they're journaling and praying daily, transformation is inevitable. Keep modeling. Keep encouraging. Keep celebrating small wins.

**Month 2 is where things get real.** Trust begins to deepen. Vulnerability increases. The Holy Spirit moves powerfully. You're ready for it.
