**Discipleship Naturally Activated**

6 Session Multiplication Manual

*And He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a **mature** man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of people, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, that is, Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.* **\- Ephesians 4:11-16 NASB**

**Teleios \- Greek Adjective**

1. brought to its end, finished  
2. wanting nothing necessary to completeness  
3. perfect  
4. that which is perfect

# **What is discipleship?**

*So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, then you are truly My disciples;* **\- John 8:31 NASB**

**Warm Up?**  
What is discipleship?   
Would you say that you have been discipled?

**Living copies of the Master**  
Many have defined discipleship in various ways. With that definition comes expectations and strategies to execute the mission. Here’s a simple definition that should clarify this word moving forward.

**Discipleship is a deliberate apprenticeship which results in, fully formed, living copies of the master.** 

Ultimately, we are apprentices of Jesus.  However, Jesus chooses to disciple us through other people just like us. Discipleship is not accidental, it’s loving people with a plan. The apprentice being discipled should be committed to soaking up everything they can from the teacher (coach, leader, mentor). A heart posture to receive and a desire to imitate Christ is necessary and should be expected in both the student and mentor.

***Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.*** 1 Corinthians 11:1 NASB

Discipleship can be misused to micro manage people’s lives which can quickly become cultic in nature. As believers, we should seek wise counsel from several mature voices but a disciple should never need your permission to make a decision in their own life. In the same way teachers should never tell a student who to marry or what kind of career path to take. These kinds of decisions should involve wisdom, prayer and ultimately confirmation from God.  
	I believe that entering into a discipleship relationship means we give someone we trust permission to question our lives. What are you afraid of? What gets you fired up? What makes you angry? What drives your spending habits? You can tell a lot about someone by the way they answer such questions. Yes, this is personal but this is what Jesus wants. Vulnerability. True discipleship requires a safe place for brokenness to be exposed, removed and healed. Discipleship is surgery “by the body to the body”, meaning we allow others to cut things out of our lives that don’t belong.

*Now He also spoke a parable to them: “A person who is blind CANNOT guide another who is blind, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit? A student is NOT ABOVE the teacher; but everyone, when he has been FULLY TRAINED, will be like his teacher.* **\- Luke 6:39-40 NASB**

**Discussion:** How do you feel about people imitating your life as you follow Christ? Does this make you uncomfortable or confident? Why?

# **The DNA of Christ**

*The earth produced vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, according to their kind; and God saw that it was good.* **\- Genesis 1:12 NASB**

If you have the seed of Christ living in you then that means you have the DNA of Christ in you. You are no longer just human. You now have the Spirit of Christ living in you. You are a new kind of human. A “holy human”; a new creation. If this is true, you will naturally produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit. And in that fruit is more seed that will multiply the DNA of Christ in others. This is not a maybe; this is the nature of Christ in us and through us. Discipleship and multiplication is a mandate for all Christians to participate in.

**John 12:24** *Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it **bears much fruit**.*

**John 15:5** *I am the vine, you are the branches; the one who remains in Me, and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.* **Verse 8 goes on to say…** *My Father is glorified by this, that you **bear much fruit**, and so prove to be My disciples*

What’s the proof? **Bear much fruit.**

Is it the right kind of fruit? We must be mindful of the seeds we sow into the lives of those we disciple. If you are a born again believer, you now have the seed of Christ growing in you. But we also have seeds of the enemy that need to be uprooted and removed from our hearts. As a leader,  you must be aware of the condition of the soil in your heart and the seeds that are actively growing in your life. You may have a root of bitterness that is unresolved. And you may be unaware that some of the seed you're planting in a disciple’s life is having an effect on their growth.

*You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they? So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. So then, you will know them by their fruits.* **\- Matthew‬ ‭7‬:‭16‬-‭20‬ ‭NASB**

**Introspective**

*I planted, Apollos watered, BUT GOD was causing the growth. 7 So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, BUT GOD who causes the growth. 8 Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 9 For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.* **\- 1 Corinthians 3:6-9 NASB**

We should all have people we trust, who can call us higher in our identity. This is why we don’t believe in maverick (solo mission) discipleship. We encourage community discipleship where leaders overlap their efforts. The goal isn’t just Spirit-filled individuals — it’s Spirit-filled multipliers who carry the DNA of Jesus. And if we carry his DNA we should accept the fact that multiplication is His nature. That’s why DNA stands for discipleship naturally activated. 

We should be able to test the fruit of one another’s lives. It comes down to this question.

Who do you trust to test the soil and seed of your life?

Who trusts you to test the soil and seed of their life?

**Your First Step Before Session Two**

*Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts; And see if there be any hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way.* **— Psalm 139:23-24 NASB**

**Before you go any further,** 

take the **Flow Assessment** at dnadiscipleship.com.

This assessment identifies 7 roadblocks that can hold back the river of God flowing through your life. It's not a test you pass or fail. It's an honest look at what might need to be addressed before you lead others.

**Here's the reality** — you can't lead people past places you haven't gone yourself. The Flow Assessment helps you see clearly so you can lead clearly.

# **Mission to Multiply**

*As for you, be fruitful and multiply;*  
*Populate the earth abundantly and multiply in it.”*

**\- Genesis 9:7 NASB**

**Warm Up?**  
How do you know if someone is ready to make disciples?

# **Two by Two**

DNA groups are built for one purpose — multiplication. Unlike seasonal programs that pause for summers and holidays, DNA is a year-round commitment to life-on-life relationship. This isn’t a curriculum you complete. It’s a covenant you live; one that addresses false mindsets, heals hidden wounds, and calls people higher into their God-given identity. 

*And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others*. **\- 2 Timothy 2:2 NIV**

**1 Leader \+ 1 Co-leader \+ 2 Disciples \= DNA Group**

Discipleship is not a solo mission. I have found that they work best in groups of 4\. Two leaders; One an experienced leader and the other, an up and coming co-leader. Each of these leaders should have one disciple each that they both raise up together as a team. Now there is an overlap of relationships and the workload of discipleship is shared. No one gets burned out. Now there is encouragement when one leader is feeling weary.

*And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.* **\- Hebrews 10:24-25 NASB**

For one cycle of DNA, you will spend 12 months (minimum 6 months in some situations) with the same group. The leader will raise up the co-leader to be a confident disciple maker and the apprentices will become future co-leads. We must communicate this upfront so people aren’t surprised when it’s time to multiply. They expect it and look forward to completing cycle 1 and starting cycle 2 as a co-leader.  
Yes, we multiply in groups but the relationship is not over. It just looks a little different as we step into the call of exponential growth. I have discipled many people and I still keep in contact with many of them. They still ask for help in their journey of discipling others. The goal is not to abandon people but to release them for success.  
Someone who has effectively been discipled should be able to repeat the process. This does not mean every disciple relationship looks the same but they are united by **“the mission of multiplication”**. The purpose is to multiply the seed of Jesus. This will include laying doctrinal foundations and moving in supernatural living.

# **Too Much Too Fast**

You may be eager to take on more disciples but it is vital that you grow as a leader in your ability to cultivate more than one or two people at once. Keep in mind you may also be cultivating a marriage, children, career relationships and friendships that still require care. 

**How many relationships can you effectively grow without living unbalanced in certain areas?** 

There is no clear answer for this but we can look at the life of Jesus and see 12 inner circle disciples as a model. Taking on 12 or more is something we need to grow into over time.

*For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?* **\- Luke 14:28**

I look at each of my kids as one of those inner circle spots, my wife as another and my closest friends in the other spots. I’m already up to 8\. How many more relationships can I do well? This is an honest conversation we must have to avoid burnout and hurting those I love. As we make disciples we will grow in our capacity to pour into more people at one time. You may only be able to handle 1 \- 3 additional people at this point in your life. This number will increase as God increases your maturity and capacity to love others well.

*I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.”* **\- John 13:34-35 NASB**

Your ability to love others is limited by your ability to be loved by God. As you receive the love of God you will naturally overflow and be able to manage more relationships. The first relationship you are responsible for is you and God (Father, Son and Spirit). Followed by your covenant relationships. By covenant we mean relationships that have signed agreements attached to them. This includes your spouse, kids, employer, and business partners. We believe that discipleship relationships are covenant agreements as well but they must be in proper order of responsibility.

**Consider this…**	  
Is your house in order?

Is your relationship with God thriving? 

Are you overflowing with love? 

What is your current capacity for discipleship?

# **Reasonable Expectations**

Your mission as a leader is to reproduce Christ in those you are raising up. With Christ, naturally comes the mission of discipleship. One cycle of DNA can take 6 months to 1 year depending on the maturity level of the apprentice when starting. As a leader, you should be proficient in the following areas. We believe these are reasonable expectations that every mature believer can rise up and be successful at.

**Healthy expectations are…**

1. **Communicated,** because you can’t expect something from someone if they are not aware and in agreement. 

2. **Attainable,** because you can’t expect something from someone they are not able to reach.

3. **Flexible,** because the seasons of life can change which means our expectations of people should be an open conversation.

**Expectations of Leaders and Co-Leaders**

1. **Fully equipped in New Covenant Doctrine.** You should have experience with the core doctrines of faith, be able to explain the core beliefs of Christianity and the reality of the New Covenant. There are many great resources to equip leaders with these core beliefs.

   *Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness* **\- 2 Timothy 2:15-16 NASB**

2. **Intentional and consistent communication.** You should care about those you are discipling and helping them reach their full potential in Christ. This requires consistent communication through various methods. You should also be consistent in communication with other DNA leaders in your community. But your disciples should also be pursuing you. Don’t become an island where your group becomes distant from the local body of believers.

   **A) Text Group** How do you encourage one another, request prayer, communicate schedules, ask for advice?

   **B) Weekly Meet, Call or Zoom** Intentional time to meet weekly for one hour.

   **C) In Person Fellowship** Organic gatherings that can include entire families for hangout, birthdays, outreach, or simply sharing meals.

   

3. **Stewarding your personal walk with Christ.** You should be able to lead yourself in devotion, worship, and discerning God’s word (Logos and Rhema). If you are not able to manage yourself according to the Holy Spirit, how can you help someone else in their spiritual formation?

   *Hold on to the example of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. Protect, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.* **\- 2 Timothy 1:13-14 NASB**

   

4. **Living with godliness and integrity.** As a leader or co-leader, you are expected to be walking in freedom, without any lifestyle of ongoing sin. We all make mistakes at times, but when we do, we experience conviction, confess to people we trust and keep it moving towards the high calling. 

   *Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, not insincere, not prone to drink much wine, not greedy for money, 9 but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 10 These men must also first be tested; then have them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach. 11 Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things. 12 Deacons must be husbands of one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households. 13 For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.* **\- 1 Timothy 3:8-13 NASB**

# **Who and why matters?**

Paul had partnerships. We should have partnerships; people we have come into agreement with to make disciples together. This person should be faithful and able to meet the reasonable expectations we listed in the previous lesson. This is someone you should be able to count on and they should be able to count on you to live with integrity and follow through. Paul had a partnership that ended in division because of a disagreement about someone’s integrity.

*After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return and visit the brothers and sisters in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.” Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. But Paul was of the opinion that they should not take along with them this man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. Now it turned into such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus. But Paul chose Silas, and left after being entrusted by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.* **\- Acts 15:36-41 NASB**

Division in the Body? Let it never be. We see here that our opinions will not always reveal someone’s true character. Paul was holding a past experience with Mark against him. So we see division between two ministers because they did not see the same thing in a disciple. Barnabas took Mark and Paul chose Silas who is also referred to in scripture as Silvanus. The good news is that Paul trusted John Mark again as he proved to be a faithful worker of the gospel, unlike Demas who is mentioned here in 2 Timothy.

*Make every effort to come to me soon; 10 for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. 11 Only Luke is with me. Take along Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.* **\- 2 Timothy 4:9-11 NASB**

Maybe you have been identified as a leader in your community, who is ready to start leading a DNA group. Before you ask God to send some disciples you should be asking for a co-leader; someone who is mature but still growing in their ability to lead a group on their own. This decision should be made with the Holy Spirit. Who is He leading you to partner with? What if it is someone you least expected?

# **Who should you disciple?**

	Pray\! I know it sounds cliche, but pray. Jesus spent time with The Father before He went out and selected the men that would follow Him the next 3 ½ years. (Luke 6:12-16) This is such an important part of the process. Many people say they want discipleship but when it comes down to it they much rather just have some friends to hang out with. 

*Now it was at this time that He went off to the mountain to pray, and He spent the whole night in prayer with God. And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles:* **\- Luke 6:12-13**

	We love and receive people right where they are at but they must be teachable, correctable and willing to be transformed by the power of Holy Spirit. When Jesus said “put down your way of living and follow me”, they could have said no. In Peter’s case he left it all to follow Jesus only to return to his fishing net after the crucifixion.  
	The point being is this… Let the Father lead you to the right person who is ready to receive what you have to offer. This means that you have to tell some people “not right now. I have to focus on the one or two that God has spoken to me about.” Jesus had large crowds that would follow him but not always for the right reasons. Big difference between fans and followers. Look what he says to the fans.

*Now large crowds were going along with Him, and He turned and said to them,  “If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple. Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.* **\- Luke 14:25-27 NASB**

**Every time I ask God to send more disciples, He does.**

*The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And one who is wise gains souls.*  
**Proverbs 11:30 NASB**

**Ask God?**  
Lord, am I ready to disciple someone?

Is there anyone you would like me to disciple?

Who can I learn from as I grow into this?

# 

# Session Three

# **Smarter.**

# **Not Harder.**

*I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,*  
*And I find knowledge and discretion.*

**\- Proverbs 8:12 NASB**

**Warm Up?**  
How do you know if someone is ready to be discipled?

# **Ready or Not?**

People come into church and hear us using words like fellowship, discipleship and evangelism. The average person has no idea what we are talking about. They are probably more familiar with words like coach, mentor, and apprenticeship. When inviting someone into a discipleship relationship, take notice of their current understanding. Are they ready or not?  
Not everyone is ready for what we are presenting here. Most people will not be able to reciprocate your commitment until they fully grasp what is being offered. They may not be good at calling you, checking in and following through. Not only are we helping people grow in relation to Jesus but also in the healthy function of life. Your job is to communicate well and be patient with them as they learn to follow your example.

*Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a full experience of salvation. Cry out for this nourishment,* **\- 1 Peter 2:2 NLT**

**We can’t offer someone spiritual milk when all they want to drink is sugar water.** 

Personally, I don’t ever ask someone to disciple them. I ask them to grab coffee and I begin to pour into them. I develop relationships and If they are receptive, I continue. Do they attend our weekly gatherings? Do they respond when I invite them to something? At the end of the day, are they crying out for nourishment? If they are not really open to this process you will be kicking yourself a few months down the road. It’s happened to me many times.  
There is a time to define the discipleship relationship. This is usually a few months into gathering that they realize what is happening. “Am I being discipled?”  Yes you are. Now, they appreciate the commitment. They value it. Don’t rush into discipleship relationships. Allow them to prove that they are hungry for this the same way that you are.

**New Disciple Checklist**

**Are they…**

1. Hungry for spiritual growth?  
   * **Do they ask questions?**

2. Receptive to coaching and correction?  
   * **Are they easily offended?**

3. Available for discipleship schedule?  
   * **Are they devoted to giving God their time?**

4. Responsive to communication?  
   * **How long does it take them to get back to you?**

**Levels of relationship**  
Pay attention to the level of relationship people can handle. You may even find that you need to grow in your ability to manage relationships that increase in intimacy. Discipleship will challenge you to step past the surface level, leap past the vulnerability phase of confession and dive into the mysterious world of change. This is where demolition and reconstruction happen by the grace of God.

* **Surface Level : Basic life details; things we do or don’t  like.**  
  * Small talk is important. It’s the common ground of society.  
* **Personal Level \- Vulnerability. The willingness to expose pain.**  
  * This shows that we are done hiding and aware of the change needed.   
* **Transformative Level \- Trust and surrender. Help me be renewed.**  
  * The desire for change exceeds the risk of staying the same. How do we walk with people here?

**Discussion**  
How would you assess the soil of someone’s heart?

Do you have the tools to cultivate their heart into good soil?

**When working with a new disciple,** start by assessing the condition of their heart before diving into deeper discipleship content. DNA is a ministry of ARK Identity. They have  free foundational courses designed to prepare new disciples for this journey. See the Free Resources section at the back of this manual for details.  

# **The 7 C’s**

# **Mark 2:** *1 When Jesus came back to Capernaum a few days later, it was heard that He was at home. 2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer space, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them. 3 And some people \*came, bringing to Him a man who was paralyzed, carried by four men. 4 And when they were unable to get to Him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Him; and after digging an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralyzed man was lying. 5 And Jesus, seeing their faith, \*said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” 6 But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking it over in their hearts, 7 “Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming\! Who can forgive sins except God alone?” 8 Immediately Jesus, aware in His spirit that they were thinking that way within themselves, \*said to them, “Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts? 9 Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven’; or to say, ‘Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk’? 10 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He \*said to the paralyzed man, 11 “I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet, and go home.” 12 And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this\!”*

# Session Four

# **Keep it Simple Saint**

*Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.* 

**\- Ephesians 5:15-16 NIV**

**Warm Up?**

# How many hours per week do you think the common Christian spends doing Christian activities?

# **Let’s get practical**

*10 Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honor; 11 not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 12 rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer, 13 contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.* **\- Romans 12:10-13 NASB**  
	  
The common “committed” Christian in America will spend up to 4 hours a week doing Christian activities. 2 hours on Sundays and 2 hours on Wednesdays. Then you have devoted Christians who want to serve in some way. That’s another 2-4 hours a week? Then you have radical followers of Jesus who have become living sacrifices. They live to commune with God and the Body of Christ as we read in the passage above.   
Casual “consumer” Christianity was never the goal. We’re looking for followers of Christ willing to live sacrificial lives as a witness to the world around them. Even so, we need to be mindful that there are only so many hours in a week; 168 to be exact. And we must be honest with ourselves. How many hours a week can you realistically devote to the multiplication of disciples? Is this a healthy weekly commitment that you can make for an extended period of time? Then we must also consider, what are healthy time expectations to have of those you are leading?

**Here’s an example of healthy weekly commitments.**

* Corporate Edification Gathering (Fellowship of the Saints) 1.5 hours  
* Biblical Training (Theology, Doctrine  and Experience) 1.5 hours  
* DNA Group (Discipleship Naturally Activated) \- 1-2 hours  
* Prayer Call (Via Conference Call) \- 30 mins (Once a week)  
* Prayer, Bible, Journal (20 \- mins daily)  
* Serving People (Charity of time) \- 1-2 hours

Some disciples may look at this and say, “I’m out.” It’s too much all at once. We need to find a way to make healthy steps towards a life devoted to Jesus.

**Discussion**  
Does this seem doable for a devoted follower of Christ? Or is this asking too much in our culture? Why do you feel this way?  
**How often should you gather?**  
Ideally, groups should meet consistently at the same time each week. But this is not always feasible. We suggest 90 minutes (minimum 60 minutes if needed). This can take place in person, over the phone or through video call. I like a mixture of in-person and Video calls because it enables groups to continue meeting even when people are traveling. Groups do not break seasonally. We may take a week or two off for Holidays or special occasions but they continue year round as the leaders and students do life together no matter what.  
In addition to the weekly meetings, we should find opportunities to share life together on a regular basis. Maybe it’s a child’s birthday or sporting event. Maybe plan an outreach opportunity to serve others or evangelize. We need to keep it fresh with different ways to engage. If I am invested in discipling people, I am hosting dinners at my house, scheduling worship nights, and creating opportunities for evangelism.  
As you may be thinking, discipleship requires a certain level of care for your people. Utilize a chat group where you can leave encouraging words, prayer requests are heard and testimonies are shared. You may spend time in prayer each day for your people and God may speak to you about them as they need guidance. God often prompts me to call people and see how they are doing, only to find out they needed a call at that exact moment.

*34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. 35 By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”* **\- John 13:34-35 NASB**

Will you welcome your disciples into your life so they can see how you handle family, finances, and freedom in Christ? This takes vulnerability in your heart as well. Consider this, when your disciples look at the way you live, would they desire to imitate Jesus in you?

*Behold, how good and how pleasant it is*  
*For brothers to live together in unity\!* **\- Psalm 133:1 NASB**

## **PB\&J. It’s That Simple**

Before we talk about weekly DNA meetings, we need to establish something critical: DNA discipleship only works if disciples commit to a daily rhythm with God. We call it PB\&J: Prayer, Bible, and Journal. It's a simple 20-30 minute daily practice: 10 minutes of prayer using the 4D Prayer rhythm and 10 minutes Bible and Journaling using the 3D Journal method. That's it. No seminary degree required. Just simple tools and 20-30 minutes daily.  
Here's the truth: If disciples won't commit to 20-30 minutes with God daily, they're not ready for a DNA group. This isn't harsh—it's honest. Without daily PBJ, weekly meetings become information transfer, not transformation. Disciples remain consumers, not contributors. But with daily PB\&J, disciples hear God's voice consistently, growth happens between meetings, and multiplication becomes natural.

**Your Job as a DNA Leader**  
Model it first. You can't lead disciples into a rhythm you don't practice yourself. Before you invite anyone to join a DNA group, make sure you're doing daily PBJ for at least 30 days. When you invite someone, be crystal clear: "DNA requires a daily commitment of 20-30 minutes: Prayer, Bible, and Journal. If you can't commit to that, this isn't the right season for you."

**Check on it weekly.**

"How many days this week did you do PBJ?"  
"What's blocking you on the days you don't?"  
"What did God say to you this week through Scripture?"

When disciples struggle with consistency, don't shame them—help them problem-solve. Is it a time issue? A "don't know what to do" issue? Or a motivation issue that signals they may not be ready yet?

**It’s Built Into The Toolkit**  
You don't have to figure out how to teach PBJ—it's built into the 90-Day Toolkit. Week 1 sets the expectation. Week 2 teaches the 3D Journal method. Week 3 teaches the 4D Prayer rhythm. Week 4 onward, you check in weekly and celebrate consistency. By Week 4, disciples should have the full PB\&J rhythm established.  
**The Bottom Line:** Before you start Phase 0, ask yourself: Am I doing daily PB\&J myself? Am I willing to set this as a non-negotiable expectation? If yes, you're ready. If not, spend the next 30 days building your own devotional rhythm first. You can't give what you don't have.

# **Your Discipleship Toolkit**

There are many different tools we can use to create a well-rounded discipleship experience. As leaders you should be using a variety of tools to fully equip your disciples.

**Life Assessment**   
These assessments consist of heart provoking questions that help pinpoint areas of a disciples life that need to be worked on. As leaders we can tell a lot about a person by the way they answer certain questions about God and life. We can also measure someone’s growth by the way their answers change over the course of a year.

**3D Journal**  
Pick a chapter of the Bible and meditate on the scripture. We encourage people to use the **3D Journal** method of processing scripture and revelation: **HEAD** (understanding), **HEART** (application), and **HANDS** (action). Everyone then gets the opportunity to deliver the revelation they received to the group and give each other feedback. This is a powerful way to activate the gift of teaching in your disciples.

**4D Prayer**  
A four-dimensional prayer rhythm designed to deepen your relationship with God, moving you from distraction to intimacy. It begins by **Revering** God through worship and focusing on His character, then moves to **Reflect** on His goodness with specific gratitude. Next, you **Request** by bringing your needs and intercessions to Him. Finally, you **Rest** in His presence, practicing stillness to listen and receive His peace. This consistent practice builds faith through celebrating the prayers God Answers.

**Creed Cards**  
An interactive collection of foundational pieces of truth that will help your students understand and wrestle with the core beliefs of the Christian Faith. These truths are rooted in the essential creeds that are non negotiables for our faith. If we say we believe then we must agree on these things. Dealing with doctrinal distortions can be the difference between a productive group and one that is stagnant.

**Listening Prayer**  
This activity involves everyone circling up and praying for the person clockwise to them. Everyone takes a few minutes to listen to what God might be saying for their assigned person. Then each of you takes time to share what you sensed and receive feedback. This helps develop a culture of hearing God for one another in your DNA group and can be a powerful tool to bring encouragement, insight, and loving correction to those you are discipling.

**Testimony Time**  
This should be done often. Disciples need to bring back good news to the group. The stories of Jesus in and through our lives are the life force to our ministry. Not only do we need to hear them but people need to declare them. Make time for this when God shows up in someone’s life. This could be a specific time of testimony or included in other gatherings.

**Q and A Discussions**  
Question and answer sessions can be a great way to open up theological discussions on many topics. Your disciples have burning questions about God that they never felt safe to ask. If you open up the conversation you will be surprised what comes up. This can also reveal a lot about who they are and maybe some lies they believe about God, the Church or the Bible.

**Simple Fellowship**  
Sometimes we simply need time to get to know each other. Hanging out on a friendship level can be a major breakthrough in the Supernatural growth in your group. Listen to God when it's time to put away the lesson plan and just be with each other in life talking, listening and learning. 

**Outing \- outreach or mission**  
No permission slips needed\! A well placed field trip works well to shake up the group and get them out of routine. Think of something exciting and maybe a little dangerous. You could include homeless ministry, street evangelism, serving somewhere as a group or maybe worshiping at a park. But it doesn’t have to be a ministry activity. It could be hiking, sports, or something creative. This will stretch your students' ability to see God in every activity of life.

**Activations (Weekly and Experiences)**  
We have designed powerful weekly activities that help people experience freedom through Biblical truth and encounters with Holy Spirit. Often we see things exposed in these activations that would have gone unnoticed without this resource. These activities can be the difference between complete freedom and lies that continue to linger in a disciples life. 

**Prayer Calls Online (30 mins)**  
Weekly prayer call over the phone or online. Don’t underestimate this tool. Prayer calls are key for uniting the hearts of everyone in the group. Nothing brings people together like encountering God’s presence corporately and releasing what God is saying. When you first start discipling someone they may be too shy to pray out loud. That’s ok. These calls are designed so everyone gets an opportunity to pray and grow in their voice, even if it is short and to the point at first.

# **God’s Way** 

*Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,*

              *But he who hates reproof is stupid (foolish).*

**\- Proverbs 12:1 NASB**

**Warm Up?**

# How do you feel about being corrected by a person of authority?

## **Connection before correction**

All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man *or woman* of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work. **\- 2 Timothy 3:16-17 NASB**

If you have stepped into a leadership role for any length of time you will realize that correction is a necessary part of the process. But how we bring correction is important. God has a plan for discipleship as we can see here in 2 Tim 3\. Teaching, Rebuke, Correction and Training. 

1. **Teaching:** Reveals the reality of Christ and exposes brokenness that we cannot see.

2. **Rebuke:**  Calls out the root of brokenness and offers a path to wholeness 

3. **Correction:** Resets the brokenness to proper alignment and covers the wound with grace

4. **Training:** Rehabilitates the area of life by exercising righteousness in Christ

There is a saying which you may have heard before that ***"People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care." *** As cliché as this may sound, it’s true. Kids test us in this everyday as they observe and learn the way we connect and love them. Adults do the same thing. The lack of connection in our childhood produces skepticism. We become guarded from disappointment and true intimacy is now replaced with busyness and surface level relationships.  
One of the ways that a father displays His love for us is through correction and discipline. It is a necessary part of the parenting process yet misused in families throughout history where fathers demand obedience at the cost of relationship. **Correction without connection will create division.**  Yet If correction is executed properly it will create and build a relationship based on truth. The one being corrected must be willing and trust in order to receive the blessing even if it hurts in the moment. 

*My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,*  
*Nor detest His correction;*  
*For whom the Lord loves He corrects,*  
*Just as a father the son in whom he delights.* **\- Proverbs 3:11-12**

### **Skin in the game** 

How do you establish connection when you've only had poor examples in your life? You may look back on your life and feel this way but let’s use an example from the Bible. One of the most famous father-son relationships in the New Testament, besides God the Father and God the Son is The apostle Paul and a young man named Timothy. 

*He (Paul) also came to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but whose father was a Greek. The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek. As they went through the towns, they passed on the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the Gentile believers to obey. * **\- Acts 16:1-4**  
   
In Acts 16 the apostle Paul meets Timothy who is half Jewish and half Greek. Timothy has a good reputation among the believers. Paul wanted him to come with him as he preached. Paul knew that the Jews would not receive Timothy into their synagogues based on the fact that his father was Greek. So Paul circumcised him. Not for legalistic reasons but to become all things to all men and win some to the Kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 9\)  
Now this all makes sense if you are in Paul's shoes but if you are Timothy you might be having some deep internal questions about letting go of a piece of your flesh. There must have been a level of rapport built between them. And Paul had to have seen something special in this young man to ask such a bold request. This is the awkward moment that propels fathers and sons into a culture of honor resulting in multi-generational revival. A brief moment of vulnerability, pain and blood that changes everything.  
This is the kind of relationship we desperately need in the church. Often the leaders of ministries have hang ups that hold them back from intimate connection with those under their guidance. There may be willing sons and daughters around who are waiting for a father to bring them into a family legacy. We see this clearly as we read the progression of Paul and Timothy's ministry.

**Paul says in 1 Corinthians 4:15**

*For though you may have ten thousand instructors in Christ, you do not have many fathers, because I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel. Therefore I urge you, imitate me. For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church*. 

Here we have a beautiful example of the fruit that comes from intimate relationships founded in sacrifice and vulnerability.  Paul boasts in his beloved and faithful son Timothy who allows him to be in many places at once. A good father can reach many places not because he is good at reaching but because he has many sons who can handle family business.  
How many of us are waiting for our Timothy or had one and failed to go the distance as a good father?  Or maybe you called him son and he called you father but when it came to the circumcision required you just weren't able to get that real. Maybe you've never been a “Timothy” to someone else and still need your own day of circumcision.  I hope by now you know I'm not talking about a literal circumcision but one of commitment into a family system designed by God.  God is the perfect representation of a father's heart. We can learn from Him and His word how to pursue connection and bring correction.

**Introspection**  
Do you have this kind of relationship with God? 

Who would you trust with a “blade”?

Are you trustworthy with a “blade” for someone else?

# **Patient when wronged**

*The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skillful in teaching, **patient when wronged**, 25 with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, 26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.* **\- 2 Timothy 2:24-26 NASB**

You will be wronged by someone you are discipling.  And you could wrong them if you are unaware of the power of your words. How you respond when you are wronged is key. Keep in mind, you are a leader because you have developed character and relationship with Christ. The person you are discipling may be coming out of broken relationships, they may live in toxic environments and have no idea how to manage a healthy friendship.   
Are you able to live “unoffendable” when your student does not respond the way you hoped they would? Christ wants to walk you through an experience He is well acquainted with; loving people who can’t yet love you back. This is what it means to answer the call of disciple making. We are saying yes to washing the feet of people who could betray us, gossip about us and take what we offer without ever being able to repay.  
The discipleship process brings out just as much growth in you as a leader as it does for the student. It challenges your ability to love people who are not ready to reciprocate the way we would expect. In my experience, I have wanted to give up after pouring so much into someone only to see them make terrible life decisions. Even after you have advised them appropriately.

*A person’s discretion makes him slow to anger,*   
*And it is his glory to overlook an offense.* **\- Proverbs 19:11 NASB**

	There are things that God wants to teach you that you will only learn by answering the call of disciple making. You will learn long suffering, sacrificial love, consistency, and hearing God for people who can’t hear yet. You will come face to face with frustration and disappointment that can only be remedied through surrender to God. In all the exposure I have helped to bring about in the hearts of others, I have been equally exposed.

## **Is He worthy?**

*Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules. The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops. Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.* **\- ‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭2‬:‭3‬-‭7‬ ‭NASB1995‬‬**

	Have I talked you out of disciple making yet? If I can talk you out of true discipleship with this short manual then I pray you have a safe journey back to country club Christianity.  But if nothing I say will detour you from saying yes to His command to make disciples then nothing will stop you. I’m sure you could find many fine pieces of literature on this subject. Some of them may work, some not. One common theme you find is that discipleship requires an unshakable yes. Here’s what I know. Jesus is worthy of a yes that is not tossed back and forth by the waves of life. He is worthy\!  
	We must come to a place where our hearts break for those who don’t know him, both in the church and outside of the church. Just because someone has been saved for years does not mean that they have been discipled into the call of Jesus to multiply. Does your heart overflow with compassion for those who fill church rows Sunday after Sunday only to manifest mediocrity in their faith week after week? I refuse to settle for lower versions of the Christian life. I also refuse to watch others settle for half of the gospel. Do you join me in this dissatisfaction?  
	  
**Here’s the reality.**   
Christ died and resurrected for a church that is able to grow, produce fruit and multiply into a grove of abundance. This is the church that creation groans for. This is the salty church that preserves the earth so more and more people can enter the Kingdom. I will lay my life down for this. But none of us can do it alone.

How are you feeling about the call of discipleship?

# Session Six

# **Are You Ready?**

Before you can prune others, you must be pruned yourself. This session is the gut check—the moment where you decide if you're actually going to launch or just stay informed.

## **Warm Up Question**

What's something God has pruned from your life in the last year? 

How did it feel at the time vs. how do you feel about it now?

## 

## **Pruning is Love**

	Pruning is the act of cutting back branches of a tree so that resources can flow to the branches that will produce even more. Without pruning we wouldn’t be as fruitful as we were created to be. No one enjoys being pruned. I don’t think anyone really enjoys pruning others. It can be uncomfortable. But it is also necessary.   
	Think of it this way; if you had an infection in your finger and no medicine to kill the infection, would you allow me to cut off your finger to save your whole body? In the same way there are things in our lives that can’t go where Jesus is taking us. Those branches must get pruned from us to allow new healthy growth to occur. Ultimately, Jesus is the gardener who tends to the growth of our lives. He decides what gets pruned and what doesn’t. We are essentially assistants to the chief gardener. Amen?  
	There is a strategy for pruning. You can’t go “clip crazy” and cut off too much too quickly. For one, we are dealing with human beings here and they need to be willing to allow an assistant gardener to come close with the clippers. Secondly, as someone who is pruning with Jesus you better be sure that this is what the Master gardener envisions. It’s like the Japanese art of Bonsai. The artist trims and wraps the tree in a very intentional way that creates a masterpiece over many  years of dedication.   
	Let’s tie this together. Are you able to see what God sees and desires in someone’s life? Are you able to go back and consult with God and your team throughout the discipleship process? Remember, you are the gardener’s assistant and at the end of the day, you must answer to Him. This is a great honor that comes with great responsibility. Let us also be willing to allow the pruning to take place in our own lives.

### **"Before You Prune Others, Be Pruned."**

* You can't lead people where you haven't gone yourself  
* The pruning you resist in your own life will become the thing you avoid in your disciples  
* Jesus was tempted in every way, yet without sin—He knows what He's asking of us

**Discussion**

What area of your life still needs pruning before you're ready to lead others?

## **The Flow Assessment Revealed.** 

## **Now What?**

Weeks ago, before Session One, you took the Personal Flow Assessment. You identified the roadblocks. You looked honestly at what could hold back the river of God in your life.

**Here's the question now — what did you do with it?**

Awareness without action is just information. The Flow Assessment wasn't designed to make you feel stuck. It was designed to show you what needs attention before you start investing in others.

Before you launch, go back to your results. Ask yourself honestly:

* Have I addressed the roadblocks I identified?  
* Am I leading myself well in the areas I said needed work?  
* Is my house in order enough to invite others in?

You don't have to be perfect. But you do have to be honest. 

**Being honest about where you are now saves you and your disciples a lot of pain later.**

## 

## **The Cost of Multiplication**

Discipleship is costly. Jesus didn't hide that from His followers, and neither should we. Before you say yes, you need to know what you're signing up for.

**What DNA will cost you:**

**Time**

* 5-7 hours per week (meetings, prep, follow-up, spontaneous texts/calls)  
* DNA doesn't break for holidays—it's year-round  
* You'll sacrifice other good things to prioritize this great thing

**Emotional Energy**

* You will be disappointed by people you invest in  
* You will have hard conversations that drain you  
* You will lose sleep praying for your disciples

**Reputation**

* People will judge your disciples' failures as YOUR failures  
* You'll be misunderstood when you have to correct someone  
* Some will call you "controlling" when you're just being faithful

**Control**

* You can't control outcomes—only faithfulness  
* Disciples will make decisions you disagree with  
* Multiplication means releasing control and trusting God

**The Reward:** But here's the truth: seeing someone step into their calling because you invested in them? There's no greater joy. Every cost is worth it when you see Jesus multiplied in others.

**Discussion** 

What part of the cost scares you most? Why?

## **Your Next Step: "The DNA Launch Guide"**

You've done the heart work. Six sessions. Now it's time for the launch work.

The DNA Launch Guide is your step-by-step blueprint from *"I want to make disciples"* to *"I'm actively discipling someone."* It will walk you through Phase 0 — finding your co-leader, identifying your disciples, setting expectations, and having the conversations that matter.

Inside Phase 0, you'll complete the **DNA Readiness Quiz** — the final checkpoint before you launch. It covers four areas: Spiritual Maturity, Life Stability, Leadership Readiness, and DNA Competency. If you're not ready yet, the quiz will tell you where to focus. If you are, it will release you to go.

**Don't wait until you feel fully ready. You never will.**

Go to **dnadiscipleship.com**, find the DNA Launch Guide, and begin Phase 0 this week.

## **Commission**

### **"You Are Called. You Are Equipped. Now Go."**

**Intro:** "Six sessions ago, you started with a question: What is discipleship? Now you know. It's a deliberate apprenticeship that results in fully formed, living copies of the Master."

**The Question Now Is:** "Will you do it?"

**Not:** "Am I qualified?" (You're not, but neither were the 12\) 

**Not:** "Do I have everything figured out?" (You don't, and you never will) 

**Not:** "What if I fail?" (You will, and that's part of the process)

**The Only Question That Matters:** "Will I obey Jesus and make disciples?"

**If the answer is yes, here's what happens:**

**2 becomes 4** You and your co-leader disciple 2 people.

**4 becomes 16** Those 2 each start their own DNA groups.

**16 becomes 256** And the multiplication continues.

**256 becomes 65,536** In just 8 generations, you've reached a city.

**This is the exponential math of the Kingdom.**

And it starts with you saying yes.

### 

### **Closing Prayer**

*Father, I thank You for calling me into this. Even though I may not be qualified, You are faithful. Even though I may make some mistakes, You cause the growth. I  know this will cost me, but Jesus, You are worthy.*

*Give me the courage to launch. Give me the patience to endure. Give me the love that never fails. Help me become a faithful disciple-maker who multiplies Your Kingdom.*

*I surrender this journey to You. Not my will, but Yours. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
