## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I have to complete the DNA Discipleship Manual first?**
A: Strongly recommended. It prepares your heart and theology. If you skip it, you may struggle with foundational concepts in the Launch Guide.

**Q: Can I use the 90-Day Toolkit for months 4-12?**
A: The 90-Day Toolkit is specifically designed for the first 12 weeks (Phase 1). After that, use the DNA Launch Guide for Phases 2-3, which gives you more flexibility to customize.

**Q: What if my disciples aren't ready to multiply after 12 months?**
A: Extend Phase 3 as needed. Some disciples need 18-24 months. Don't rush multiplication—it's about readiness, not timeline.

**Q: Can I skip Phase 0?**
A: No. Phase 0 is critical for setting up your group well. Rushing into Week 1 without proper preparation leads to preventable problems.

**Q: Do I need to use every tool in the 90-Day Toolkit?**
A: For the first 12 weeks, yes—follow the Toolkit exactly. It's been designed to build sequentially. After Week 12, you have more freedom to customize.
