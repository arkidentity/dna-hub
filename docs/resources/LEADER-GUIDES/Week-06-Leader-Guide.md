## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Opening + Worship (10 min)
- Play worship songs (optional but helpful)
- Brief prayer inviting Holy Spirit to speak

### 2. Teaching on Hearing God for Others (15 min)
**Key Points:**
- God still speaks today (1 Cor 14:1)
- Prophetic is for everyone, not just "super-spiritual" people
- Purpose: Edification, encouragement, comfort (1 Cor 14:3)
- How God speaks: Impressions, pictures, Scripture, words

**How to test it:**
- Does it align with Scripture?
- Does it edify and encourage?
- Does it produce life or fear?

### 3. Listening Prayer Activity (50 min)
**How it works:**
- Sit in a circle
- Each person prays for the person to their right
- Take 3-5 min silence to listen: "God, what do You see when You look at [name]?"
- Write down everything you receive
- Go around: Each person shares what they received
- Receiver responds: "What resonated?"

**Round 1: Practice (20 min) - Optional**
**Round 2: Real Round (30 min) - Go deeper**

**Leader's role:**
- Go first to model
- Coach in real-time: "That's good. What else?"
- Gently redirect if way off
- Celebrate when someone nails it

### 4. Debrief (10 min)
- "How did that feel?"
- "Did you hear God more clearly than expected?"

### 5. Closing (5 min)
- Thank God for speaking
- Prepare for Week 7: Outreach next week—bring details
