### 2. The Outreach (90 min)
**During the activity:**
- Leaders model first, then release disciples
- Stay in pairs for safety
- Look for Holy Spirit highlights
- Be bold but not pushy
- Pray when prompted

**Simple script:**
"Hey, we're from [church/group] and we're out praying for people today. Is there anything we can pray for you about?"

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: "I'm scared to do outreach."**
✅ **Solution:** "Good. That means you're relying on God, not yourself. Do it scared."

**Problem: Someone freezes and can't do it.**
✅ **Solution:** Don't shame them. Let them observe first. "You don't have to do it today. Watch. Next time you'll be ready."
