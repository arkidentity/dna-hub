**Pre-Launch Checklist for DNA Leaders**

*For detailed guidance, see the full DNA Launch Guide Phase 0 section.*

---

## 🎯 PHASE 0 OVERVIEW

**Duration:** 6 weeks before Week 1
**Goal:** Prepare yourself, find a co-leader, invite disciples, and set expectations

---

## ✅ WEEK 1-2: PREPARE YOURSELF

### Checkpoint 1: Self-Assessment
☐ Complete DNA Readiness Quiz (if not done after Session 6)
☐ Pray: "God, am I ready to lead? What do I need to address first?"
☐ Identify any personal barriers to leading (time, fear, unresolved sin)

### Checkpoint 2: Find Your Co-Leader
☐ Write a list of 3-5 potential co-leaders
☐ Pray over the list daily for one week
☐ Invite the person God highlights to coffee
☐ Share the vision for DNA discipleship
☐ Ask: "Would you co-lead a DNA group with me for 12 months?"

### Checkpoint 3: Set Up Your Rhythms
☐ Decide meeting day/time (same time weekly for 12 months)
☐ Decide meeting location (home, coffee shop, church, online)
☐ Set up group communication (text group, WhatsApp, GroupMe)
☐ Schedule weekly co-leader debrief time (30 min after each meeting)

---

## ✅ WEEK 3-4: PRAY & IDENTIFY

### Checkpoint 4: Prayer Strategy
☐ Commit to praying daily for 2 weeks before inviting anyone
☐ Create a list of 3-5 potential disciples
☐ Pray specifically: "God, who are You calling me to invest in?"
☐ Look for people who are:
  - Spiritually hungry (asking questions, seeking more)
  - Faithful in small things (consistent, reliable)
  - Available (can commit to 12 months)
  - Teachable (humble, open to growth)

### Begin Informal Conversations
☐ Have coffee with 3-5 people on your list
☐ Ask questions:
  - "How's your relationship with God these days?"
  - "What's God been teaching you lately?"
  - "Where do you want to grow spiritually?"
☐ Listen for hunger, not perfection
☐ Don't make the invitation yet—just build relationship

---

## ✅ WEEK 5-6: INVITE & COMMIT

### The Direct Conversation (Week 5)
☐ Schedule a follow-up meeting with your top 2 candidates
☐ Share the DNA vision clearly:
  - "I'm starting a DNA group—a 12-month discipleship journey."
  - "It's 1 leader + 1 co-leader + 2 disciples = 4 people total."
  - "We meet weekly for 90 minutes, and at the end, you'll be ready to start your own group."
☐ Ask: "Would you be interested in joining?"

### Set Expectations Together (Week 5-6)
☐ If they say yes, schedule a commitment conversation
☐ Use the "Setting Expectations" section from DNA Launch Guide
☐ Cover these topics:
  - **Time commitment:** Weekly 90-min meetings + daily personal habits
  - **Duration:** 12 months (no dropping out after 3 months)
  - **Vulnerability required:** This isn't a Bible study; it's deep discipleship
  - **Multiplication expectation:** At Month 12, you'll start your own group
  - **Life-on-life, not just meetings:** Expect texts, calls, and hangouts
☐ Have them sign the DNA Group Agreement
☐ Schedule Week 1 meeting date

### Final Prep (Week 6)
☐ Download Week 1 materials from 90-Day Toolkit
☐ Prepare your home or reserve meeting space
☐ Send Week 1 reminder text to all disciples
☐ Pray together with co-leader for Week 1
☐ Review "Common Week 1 Mistakes" in 90-Day Toolkit

## 🚨 COMMON PHASE 0 MISTAKES

### Mistake #1: Skipping the co-leader
**Why it's a problem:** You'll burn out, and no one will multiply.
**Solution:** Don't start without a co-leader. Wait if you need to.

### Mistake #2: Inviting too many people
**Why it's a problem:** DNA groups work best with 4 people (1 leader + 1 co-leader + 2 disciples).
**Solution:** If more than 2 people say yes, either start 2 groups or have them wait for the next group.

### Mistake #3: Not setting clear expectations
**Why it's a problem:** People drop out when reality doesn't match expectations.
**Solution:** Over-communicate the commitment level. Better to scare them off now than lose them at Month 6.

### Mistake #4: Rushing the invitation
**Why it's a problem:** You pick the wrong people or they say yes without understanding.
**Solution:** Follow the 6-week process. Don't skip the prayer and coffee conversations.

### Mistake #5: Starting without the DNA Group Agreement
**Why it's a problem:** No written commitment = easy to back out later.
**Solution:** Have EVERY disciple sign the agreement before Week 1.
