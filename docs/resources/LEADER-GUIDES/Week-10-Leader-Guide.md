## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Opening: The Identity Transfer (8 min)
**Leader opens:**
"Christ has already transferred His identity to you. You're no longer who you were. You're who He says you are. But just because He's given us this new identity doesn't mean we automatically experience it. We have to come into agreement with it."

**Opening Prayer:**
"God, open our eyes to see ourselves the way You see us. In Jesus' name."

### 2. The Mirror Test: How Do You See Yourself? (7 min)
**Leader guides:**
"Answer this honestly: When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? What kind of person are you?"
- Give 4-5 min to write
- **Don't share yet**—move to next section

### 3. Listening Prayer: How Does God See You? (10 min)
"Now ask God: 'God, when You look at me, what do You see?'"
- Give 7 min silence to listen and write
- Play soft music
- You might hear: A word, a picture, a Scripture, a feeling

### 4. The Identity Gap (10 min)
**Leader teaches:**
"Look at what you wrote. Notice the difference? **One of you is wrong.** And it's not God.

Your perception of yourself is distorted by lies, wounds, shame. **Who He says I am is who I truly am.**"

### 5. Teaching: The Gideon Encounter (15 min)
**Read Judges 6:11-16**
- God calls Gideon "mighty man of valor" while he's hiding in fear
- Gideon doesn't receive it—argues based on earthly standards
- God doesn't argue—just says, "I will be with you."

**False humility = exalting your opinion of you over what God says about you.**

**Declare together (2-3 times):**
"I am who Jesus says I am."

### 6. Teaching: Do You Agree? (15 min)
**2 Corinthians 1:18-20** - Our job is to say "Amen" (I agree)

**Two statements to agree with:**
1. Who God says He is (God Dependent)
2. Who God says I am (God Confident)

**Draw Identity Diagram:**
- Horizontal: Insecure ↔ Arrogant
- Vertical: Independent ↔ Co-dependent
- Center: Christ (True Humility + God Dependence)

### 7. Identity Battle Plan Workshop (15 min)
**Introduce the tool:**
"When the enemy attacks your identity, you need Scripture to fight back."

**Two columns:**
1. **Who I Am** (with Scripture)
2. **Who He Is** (corresponding attribute of God)

Example:
- Who I am: "More than conquerors" (Rom 8:37)
- Who He is: "Gracious giver" (Rom 8:32)

**Activity (15 min):**
- Fill in at least 3-5 lines
- Use Bible, ask for help, search verses
- This is a lifelong tool—keep adding to it

### 8. Declarations + Closing (10 min)
**Go around circle:**
Each person declares one "Who I am" statement with Scripture
Group responds: "Amen."

**Closing prayer:**
"Father, we seal this truth. We are who You say we are. Guard these truths in our hearts. In Jesus' name."

---

## 📊 AFTER THE MEETING

☐ Text within 24 hours: "What's one truth God spoke over you that's sticking?"
☐ Encourage: "Read your Identity Battle Plan every morning this week."
☐ Watch for identity attacks this week—remind disciples to use their Battle Plan
☐ **Send Spiritual Gifts Assessment link 3-4 days before Week 11**
☐ Prepare for Week 11: Review Spiritual Gifts teaching

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: Someone can't hear God during listening prayer.**
✅ **Solution:** "What's something you've always wished God would say about you? Ask Him if that's true."

**Problem: Someone struggles to find Scripture.**
✅ **Solution:** Help them search. Start with Romans 8, Ephesians 1-2, 1 Peter 2, Colossians 3.
