- "Welcome to Week 1! This is the beginning of a 12-month journey together."
- "Tonight we'll complete the Life Assessment—a tool to measure where you are spiritually right now."

**Opening prayer:**
"God, thank You for bringing us together. Give us courage to be honest tonight. Help us see where we are and where You want to take us. In Jesus' name."

### 2. Cast Vision for DNA (10 min)
**Leader shares:**
- "DNA stands for Discipleship, Nurture, Accountability."
- "Our goal: To become followers of Jesus who make followers of Jesus."
- "Here's what the next 12 months will look like:"
  - Months 1-3 (Weeks 1-12): Foundation building with the 90-Day Toolkit
  - Months 4-6: Co-leadership development
  - Months 7-12: Multiplication preparation
  - Month 12: You launch your own DNA group

**Co-leader shares:**
- "This isn't just a Bible study. It's life-on-life discipleship."
- "We'll laugh, cry, pray, serve, and grow together."
- "At the end, you won't just know more—you'll BE different."

### 3. Complete Life Assessment (25 min)

**Leader guides:**
- "I'm sending the Life Assessment link to our group chat right now."
- "Open it on your phone or laptop."
- "There are 42 questions across 7 categories. Answer honestly—not what you think we want to hear."
- "We'll all complete it together right now, including me and [co-leader]."

**Send the link from your DNA Groups Dashboard**

**While they complete:**
- Leaders complete the assessment alongside disciples (model vulnerability)
- Play soft background music (optional)
- Be available if anyone has technical issues
- Watch for anyone who seems stuck or emotional—check in quietly

**When everyone finishes:**
- "Great job. Your results are saved in the system."
- "We're going to talk about what stood out to each of you."

---

### 4. Share & Discuss Results (35 min)

**Leader kicks off (go first to model vulnerability):**
- "I want to share what stood out to me in my assessment."
- "My lowest category was [category]. I realized I'm struggling with [specific issue]."
- "My highest category was [category], which encouraged me."
- "One area I want to grow in over the next 12 weeks is [specific goal]."

**Co-leader shares next (2-3 minutes)**

**Then disciples share (10 minutes each):**

**Prompts for discussion:**
- "What surprised you about your results?"
- "Which category was lowest? Why do you think that is?"
- "Which category was highest? What's contributing to that?"
- "What's one area you want to focus on over the next 12 weeks?"

**Leader's role during sharing:**
- Listen more than you talk
- Ask follow-up questions to go deeper
- Affirm every honest answer: "Thank you for sharing that."
- Don't judge or shame—create safety
- Take mental notes for future coaching

---

### 5. Introduce the 4 Core DNA Tools (5 min)

**Leader teaches:**
"Over the next 4 weeks, we'll introduce 4 foundational tools that will transform your spiritual life:
- **Week 2: 3D Journal** – A simple way to hear God through Scripture daily
- **Week 3: 4D Prayer Rhythm** – A framework for praying consistently
- **Week 4: Creed Cards** – Building your theological foundation

These aren't just information—they're transformation tools."

### 6. Closing Prayer & Next Week Preview (5 min)

**Leader prays over each person:**
- "God, thank You for [name]. I pray You would meet them in [area they mentioned]. Grow them in [specific category]. In Jesus' name."

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: The assessment took longer than 25 minutes.**
✅ **Solution:** That's okay. Extend the meeting or finish discussion next week. Don't rush vulnerability.

**Problem: Someone got emotional during sharing.**
✅ **Solution:** This is normal and healthy. Sit with them. Offer tissues. Pray quietly. Don't rush them.

**Problem: Someone seemed guarded and surface-level.**
✅ **Solution:** That's okay for Week 1. Trust takes time. Model vulnerability and they'll follow.

**Problem: Technical issues with the assessment link.**
✅ **Solution:** Have them complete it on your phone or laptop. Or send the link again and have them finish at home, then discuss next week.

**Problem: Someone scored low in every category and seems discouraged.**
✅ **Solution:** Reframe it: "This isn't about where you are—it's about where you're going. 12 weeks from now, you'll be amazed at your growth."
