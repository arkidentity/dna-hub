## 📅 BEFORE THE MEETING

☐ Text disciples: "Week 5 is Q&A—bring your hardest questions. No question is off-limits."
☐ Prepare a few vulnerable questions of your own to model openness
☐ Don't feel pressure to have all the answers
☐ Review common question categories in full 90-Day Toolkit

## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Opening + Ground Rules (10 min)
**Set the tone:**
- "This is a safe space. Ask anything."
- "We pursue truth, not just winning arguments."
- "It's okay to say 'I don't know.'"
- "Doubt is not the opposite of faith—certainty is."

### 2. Question Gathering (5 min)
- Go around: Each person shares their question
- Write them all down
- Don't answer yet—just collect

### 3. Q&A Discussion (70 min)
**Process for each question:**
1. Read the question out loud
2. Ask: "What do you think? What does Scripture say?"
3. Let the GROUP wrestle first
4. Leaders provide biblical clarity
5. Point to Scripture as much as possible

**If you don't know:** "Great question. Let me research that and we'll revisit it."

### 4. Closing (5 min)
- Thank them for honesty
- Pray for continued revelation
- Remind: "Faith isn't the absence of questions—it's trusting God even when we don't have all the answers."
