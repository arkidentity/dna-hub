## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Check-In + Opening Prayer (10 min)
- "How was your week? Any updates since last week?"
- "Did God speak to you about anything from your Life Assessment?"
- Brief prayer inviting Holy Spirit to teach

### 2. Teaching: What is 3D Journal? (20 min)
**The 3 D's:**
1. **DISCOVERY** – What does the text say? (Observe)
2. **DECLARATION** – What is God saying to me? (Apply)
3. **DEVOTION** – What will I do in response? (Obey)

**Why this works:**
- Moves from head knowledge → heart transformation → hands obedience
- Simple enough for anyone, deep enough for lifelong growth
- Takes 10-15 minutes daily

### 3. Live Demonstration (15 min)
**Leader demonstrates:**
- Pick a Scripture (e.g., Psalm 23:1)
- Model Discovery: "What do I observe? The Lord is my shepherd..."
- Model Declaration: "God, what are You saying to me through this?"
- Model Devotion: "I will trust You today with [specific situation]."

### 4. Practice Together (30 min)
- Give everyone the same Scripture
- 10 min silent journaling
- Share what God said (5 min each person)

### 5. Challenge + Closing (15 min)
**This week's challenge:**
- Do 3D Journal daily for 7 days
- Share one journal entry in group chat this week

## 📊 AFTER THE MEETING

☐ Text disciples: "How's 3D Journaling going? Send me a screenshot of one entry!"
☐ Follow up with anyone who didn't share in group chat
☐ Prepare for Week 3: 4D Prayer teaching

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: "I don't hear God saying anything."**
✅ **Solution:** "Start with what the text says. God speaks through His Word. Even if it feels simple, write it down."

**Problem: "I don't have time for this daily."**
✅ **Solution:** "What if you replaced 10 minutes of social media with this? It's about priority, not time."
