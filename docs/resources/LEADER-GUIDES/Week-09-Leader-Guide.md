## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Opening + Worship (10 min)
- Create holy atmosphere
- Invite Holy Spirit to lead
- "Tonight we're experiencing freedom, not just learning about it."

### 2. Teaching: What is a Stronghold? (15 min)
**2 Corinthians 10:3-5**
- A stronghold = a lie that's become entrenched
- Examples: "God doesn't love me," "I'm not enough," "I'll always struggle with this"
- Where they come from: Wounds, words spoken over you, sin patterns, demonic oppression

**The goal tonight:**
We're not picking areas for you to work on. The Holy Spirit knows exactly what needs to be addressed. We'll ask Him to reveal it.

### 3. Introduce Reveal, Renounce, Replace (10 min)
**3-Step Process:**
1. **REVEAL** – Ask God to show you the lie
2. **RENOUNCE** – Verbally break agreement with it
3. **REPLACE** – Ask God what He wants to give you instead

**Critical principle:** We never leave a space empty. We REPLACE lies with truth.

### 4. Guided Deliverance Session (35 min)

**REVEAL (10 min)**
- Dim lights, play soft music
- "Close your eyes. Ask God: 'Is there a lie I'm believing? A stronghold You want to break tonight?'"
- Give 10-15 min silence to listen and write

**RENOUNCE (10 min)**
- Lead them through renunciation prayer (see Toolkit for full prayer)
- They pray out loud (whisper or bold):
  - "God, I've been believing the lie that _____."
  - "I renounce this lie in Jesus' name."
  - "I break agreement with _____."
  - "I forgive _____ for contributing to this lie."
  - "I command this stronghold to leave NOW."

**REPLACE (10 min)**
- "Ask God: 'What do You want to give me instead? What is the TRUTH?'"
- Give 10 min to listen and write

**DECLARE (5 min)**
- Go around circle: Each person shares:
  1. The lie they renounced
  2. The truth God is giving them
- Group responds: "Amen. We receive that."
- Leaders pray quick blessing over each person

### 5. Closing Prayer (15 min)
- Seal the work by the blood of Jesus
- Pray protection over each disciple
- Commission: "When the lie tries to come back, renounce it again and declare the truth."

## 📊 AFTER THE MEETING

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: Someone can't hear anything during REVEAL.**
✅ **Solution:** Quietly pray with them. Ask: "What's been the hardest struggle lately? Let's ask God about that."

**Problem: Someone breaks down emotionally.**
✅ **Solution:** This is normal. Let them cry. Sit with them. Don't rush them.

**Problem: Someone reveals trauma/abuse.**
✅ **Solution:** Pray peace over them tonight. Privately offer to connect them with counselor/pastor. Follow up within 24 hours.
