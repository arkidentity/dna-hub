## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Opening Worship + Reflection (10 min)
- Worship and thank God for the last 12 weeks
- "Tonight we're celebrating what God has done in each of you."

### 2. Retake Life Assessment (20-30 min)
**Send the Link:**
- "I'm sending the Week 12 Life Assessment to our group chat."
- "Same 42 questions you answered in Week 1."
- "Answer honestly based on where you are TODAY."

**While They Complete:**
- Pray for each disciple
- Monitor dashboard—watch for submissions
- Once submitted, dashboard auto-generates Week 1 vs Week 12 comparison PDFs

**Download Comparison PDFs:**
- Access from DNA Groups Dashboard after all submissions
- Pull up on device during discussion (or print beforehand)

### 3. Explain the Comparison Report (5 min)
**Leader explains:**
"The dashboard generated a comparison report for each of you showing:
- Your Week 1 scores vs Week 12 scores in all 7 categories
- Percentage change in each category
- Specific questions where you saw biggest growth
- Your open-ended responses from both weeks, side-by-side"

**Silent Reflection (5 min):**
- Hand out PDFs or show on screen
- Let them read silently
- Watch for reactions—smiles, tears, surprise

### 4. Individual Sharing + Celebration (40 min - 10 min each)
**For each person, discuss:**
1. "What growth surprised you?"
2. "Which category showed the most improvement?"
3. "Where do you still want to focus?"
4. "What's one specific thing you'll do in the next 3 months?"

**Leader's role:**
- Celebrate EVERY growth, no matter how small
- Be specific: "Week 1 you said you couldn't hear God. Last week you gave a prophetic word. That's GROWTH."
- Let the group affirm each other
- If someone stagnated, be honest but kind: "What's holding you back? What do you need from us?"

### 5. Group Celebration + Vision Casting (10 min)
**Celebrate together:**
- "What growth have you seen in each other?"
- Leaders share what they've observed in each disciple

**Vision casting:**
- "These 12 weeks were just the beginning."
- "Our goal is for you to multiply—to do this with someone else."
- "Phase 2 (Months 4-6): You'll start co-facilitating meetings."
- "Phase 3 (Months 7-12): You'll prepare to launch your own group."

### 6. Closing Prayer + Commissioning (5 min)
**Pray over each person:**
- Thank God for their growth
- Speak vision: "You're becoming a disciple-maker."

**Commission:**
"You've completed the 12-week toolkit. Now the real work begins. This isn't the end—it's the beginning of a lifestyle."

☐ Debrief with co-leader:
  - "Who showed the most growth?"
  - "Who is ready to start thinking about multiplication?"
