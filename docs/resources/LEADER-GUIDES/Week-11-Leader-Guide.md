## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Opening: The Father of Lights (10 min)
**Leader opens:**
"Tonight we're talking about spiritual gifts. But first: **These gifts don't define you. They don't make you more loved.**

You are beloved FIRST. Gifted SECOND.

***James 1:17*** – 'Every good gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.'"

**Opening Prayer:**
"Father, show us how You've wired us. Unlock the gifts You've placed inside us. Help us use them to serve others, not ourselves."

### 2. Identity First: Gifts Don't Define You (10 min)
**Leader teaches:**
"Your spiritual gifts are NOT your identity. When we make our gifts our identity, we get pride, comparison, insecurity, or burnout.

**1 Corinthians 12:4-7** – Same Spirit, same Lord, same God. Your gifts reveal HOW you'll serve, not WHO you are."

### 3. Review Assessment Results (15 min)
**The 3 Tiers:**
- **Tier 1: How You Serve** (Romans 12) – Everyone has these
- **Tier 2: Supernatural Empowerment** (1 Cor 12) – Grow into these
- **Tier 3: Leadership Calling** (Eph 4) – Some, not all

**Pair up (10 min):**
- Share top 2-3 gifts from Tier 1
- Share 1-2 gifts from Tier 2 you DESIRE most
- Partner affirms: "I can see that in you because..."

### 4. One Body, Many Parts (10 min)
**1 Corinthians 12:12-20**
"You are necessary. Without you, the Body is incomplete.

All gifts are equally valuable:
- Serving = as valuable as Prophecy
- Mercy = as needed as Teaching
- Administration = as important as Miracles

**Play your part.**"

### 5. Teaching: Understanding the Gifts (15 min)
Quick overview of gifts in all 3 tiers (see full Toolkit for details)

**Key point:** Character > Gifts. Fruit of the Spirit matters more than supernatural abilities.

### 6. Impartation & Activation (20 min)
**2 Timothy 1:6-7** – "Fan into flame the gift of God in you through laying on of hands."

**The Process:**
1. **ACCESS** – Submit to Holy Spirit
2. **ASK** – Ask boldly as beloved children
3. **ACTIVATE** – Use the gift immediately

**Format:**
- Group lays hands on each person
- Leader prays specifically for their top 2 gifts
- Immediately after prayer, that person USES the gift (see activation ideas in Toolkit)

### 7. Debrief + Closing (10 min)
**Debrief:**
- "What did you experience when you activated your gift?"
- "Did anyone see breakthrough?"

**Challenge:**
"This week, use your top gift to serve someone outside this group."

**Closing Prayer:**
"Father, seal this. We are vessels of Your power—for the 'common good' of the Body. In Jesus' name."

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: Someone claims to have ALL the gifts.**
✅ **Solution:** "That's pride or misunderstanding. We all have SOME, not ALL."

**Problem: Someone dismisses their gifts as "not important."**
✅ **Solution:** "That's false humility or insecurity. God designed you specifically. Your gifts matter."
