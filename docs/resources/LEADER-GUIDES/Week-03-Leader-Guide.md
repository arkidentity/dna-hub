# WEEK 3 LEADER GUIDE
**4D Prayer Rhythm (In The Gap)**

*For detailed teaching notes, see 90-Day Toolkit Month 1.*

---

## 🎯 THIS WEEK'S GOAL
Teach disciples a simple, sustainable daily prayer rhythm using the 4D framework.

---

## 📅 BEFORE THE MEETING

☐ Text disciples: "Week 3 is 4D Prayer—learning to pray like Jesus did."
☐ Check: Are disciples doing their 3D Journals? Follow up if not.
☐ Print or prepare 4D Prayer cards/handouts (optional)
☐ Prepare to share your own 4D Prayer example

## ⏱️ MEETING FLOW (90 MINUTES)

### 1. Check-In + 3D Journal Debrief (15 min)
- "How did 3D Journaling go this week?"
- "What did God say to you through Scripture?"
- Celebrate anyone who did it daily

### 2. Teaching: The 4D Prayer Rhythm (25 min)
**The 4 D's:**
1. **DEVOTION** – Worship and thanksgiving (5 min)
2. **DECLARATION** – Speak truth over yourself (5 min)
3. **DEPENDENCE** – Pray for your needs (5 min)
4. **DEFENSE** – Intercede for others (5 min)

**Why this works:**
- Prevents selfish "gimme" prayers
- Starts with God's character (Devotion) before our needs
- Balances personal prayer + intercession
- Teaches us to pray Scripture (Declaration)

### 3. Practice Together (30 min)
**Walk through each D live:**
- 5 min Devotion: "Who is God? What are we thankful for?"
- 5 min Declaration: "What truth from Scripture do we need today?"
- 5 min Dependence: "What do we need from God today?"
- 5 min Defense: "Who needs our prayers?"

### 4. Challenge + Closing (20 min)
**This week's challenge:**
- Pray 4D daily for 7 days (20 min total)
- Pair it with your 3D Journal (30 min total daily)
- Share one answered prayer in group chat

## 📊 AFTER THE MEETING

☐ Text disciples: "How's 4D Prayer going? What's God answering?"
☐ Prepare for Week 4: Creed Cards teaching

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: "20 minutes of prayer feels too long."**
✅ **Solution:** "Start with 10. Quality over quantity. Even 5 minutes with intention is better than 30 distracted."

**Problem: "I don't know what to declare."**
✅ **Solution:** "Use Scripture. Declare who God says you are. Use your Identity Battle Plan from Week 10 (coming soon)."
