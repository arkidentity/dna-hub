# PBJ: YOUR DAILY RHYTHM
**Prayer, Bible, Journal**

*A simple guide for DNA disciples*

---

## 🥜 WHAT IS PBJ?

**PBJ = Prayer, Bible, Journal**

It's a simple daily rhythm that takes **20-30 minutes**:

- **P = Prayer** (10 minutes using 4D Prayer)
- **B = Bible** (5-10 minutes reading Scripture)
- **J = Journal** (5-10 minutes using 3D Journal)

That's it. No seminary degree required. No special training needed. Just you, God, a Bible, and a pen.

---

## 💡 WHY DOES IT MATTER?

### It Works
Research from Level 5 churches (the top 5% of multiplying churches) shows:
- **72% of people** who do PBJ daily report a deeper connection with Jesus
- Churches using PBJ see natural multiplication to 4th generation disciples
- **1,200+ people** at one church practice this rhythm—and it's spreading

### It's Simple Enough for Anyone
- Teenagers lead groups using this
- Brand new believers can do it
- You don't need to be "spiritual" to start
- If you can read, you can do PBJ

### It's the Engine of DNA
**Without daily PBJ:**
- Weekly DNA meetings become Bible studies (information transfer)
- You remain a consumer, not a contributor
- Multiplication doesn't happen

**With daily PBJ:**
- You hear God's voice regularly
- You grow consistently, not sporadically
- You become equipped to disciple others
- Transformation happens naturally

## 📖 HOW TO DO PBJ

### STEP 1: PRAYER (10 minutes)
Use the **4D Prayer** framework you'll learn in Week 3:

1. **Devotion** (2-3 min) - Worship and thanksgiving
   - "God, You are..."
   - "Thank You for..."

2. **Declaration** (2-3 min) - Speak truth over yourself
   - "I am who You say I am..."
   - Declare Scripture over your life

3. **Dependence** (2-3 min) - Pray for your needs
   - "I need Your help with..."
   - Bring your requests to God

4. **Defense** (2-3 min) - Intercede for others
   - Pray for family, friends, your DNA group
   - Pray for people you're reaching

---

### STEP 2: BIBLE (5-10 minutes)
**Just read Scripture.** That's it.

**How much?**
- Start with 1 chapter
- Or use a reading plan (YouVersion app, Bible in a Year, etc.)
- Or follow what your DNA leader assigns

**What to read?**
- If you're new to the Bible: Start with the Gospel of John
- If you want to grow deeper: Rotate between Gospels, Psalms, Proverbs, and New Testament letters
- Ask your DNA leader for recommendations

**Don't overthink it—just read.**

---

### STEP 3: JOURNAL (5-10 minutes)
Use the **3D Journal** method you'll learn in Week 2:

**The 3 D's:**

1. **DISCOVERY** - What does the text say?
   - "I read [passage]"
   - "I observed..."
   - Write down what stood out to you

2. **DECLARATION** - What is God saying to me?
   - "God, what are You saying to me through this?"
   - Listen and write what you hear
   - Even if it feels simple, write it down

3. **DEVOTION** - What will I do in response?
   - "Today, I will..."
   - Make it specific and actionable
   - This is your obedience commitment

**Pro tip:** Keep it simple. Don't write a sermon. A few sentences per D is enough.

## ⏰ WHEN SHOULD I DO PBJ?

**Pick a consistent time.** Here are common options:

### Morning (Most Common)
- Before work/school
- Sets the tone for your day
- Quietest time in most homes
- "Seek first the kingdom of God" (Matt 6:33)

### Lunch Break
- Mid-day reset
- Good if mornings are chaotic
- Many people do this in their car

### Evening
- After kids go to bed
- Reflect on the day
- Process what God did

**The best time is the time you'll actually do it.**

## 🚧 "BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME..."

### You Have Time—It's About Priority
- 20-30 minutes = Less than one episode of a TV show
- You probably spend 30+ minutes on social media daily
- This isn't about finding time—it's about making time

### Start Small and Build
- Week 1: Do 10 minutes (even if imperfect)
- Week 2: Add more as it becomes habit
- Week 3: Aim for full 20-30 minutes
- Grace for imperfection, but commitment to consistency

### Remove Barriers
- **Put your Bible by your coffee maker** (if you do mornings)
- **Set a phone alarm** (with a reminder: "PBJ Time")
- **Tell someone** (your DNA leader, spouse, friend) to ask you daily: "Did you do PBJ?"
- **Use the same spot every day** (kitchen table, couch, car, wherever)

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

### "What if I miss a day?"
**Grace, not guilt.** Life happens. Just pick it back up the next day. The goal is consistency over time, not perfection.

### "What if I don't 'feel' anything?"
**Do it anyway.** PBJ isn't about feelings—it's about faithfulness. Some days will feel powerful. Some days will feel dry. Show up either way.

### "What if I can't hear God during the Journal part?"
**Write what the Scripture says.** God speaks through His Word. Even if you don't hear a "lightning bolt moment," write down what the text is teaching you.

### "Can I do PBJ at different times throughout the day?"
**Yes, but...** It's better to do all three together if possible. The rhythm works best as a connected practice. But if splitting it up is the only way, do that.

### "Do I have to do it in this order (P-B-J)?"
**No.** Many people do B-J-P (Bible, Journal, Prayer). Find what works for you. The order doesn't matter—the consistency does.

## 🎯 THE NON-NEGOTIABLE COMMITMENT

**Here's the truth:**

If you're not willing to spend 20-30 minutes with God daily, you're not ready for a DNA group.

This isn't harsh—it's honest. **DNA isn't a Bible study where you show up once a week and absorb information.** DNA is about becoming a disciple who makes disciples. That requires daily time with Jesus.

**Your DNA leader is doing PBJ daily.**
**Your co-leader is doing PBJ daily.**
**Every disciple in your group is committing to PBJ daily.**

This is the engine. Without it, nothing else works.

## ✅ YOUR CHALLENGE

### Week 1: Build the Rhythm

- Week 3: Learn 4D Prayer structure
- Now you have the full PBJ framework

### Week 4 and Beyond: Live the Rhythm
- Do PBJ daily for 12 months
- Check in with your DNA group weekly
- Celebrate wins, problem-solve barriers together
- Watch your life transform
