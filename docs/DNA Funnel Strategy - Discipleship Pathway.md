# Email Automation Sequence

## Email 1: Immediate Delivery (Triggered on form submission)

**Subject:** ✓ Your DNA Resources Are Here

**Preview Text:** Everything you need to start making disciples who make disciples

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Thanks for downloading the DNA Discipleship system!

**📥 Here are your resources:**

[Download Button] DNA Discipleship Manual (PDF)  
[Download Button] DNA Launch Guide (PDF)  
[Download Button] DNA 8-Week Toolkit (PDF)

**Where to start:**

Read the **DNA Discipleship Manual first** (6 sessions, ~49 pages). It'll give you the heart and theology behind multiplication discipleship.

Then use the **Launch Guide** to create your roadmap from "I want to disciple" to "I'm actively discipling."

The **8-Week Toolkit** gives you week-by-week meeting plans once your DNA group launches.

---

**Want more?**

I built a **DNA Leaders Dashboard** with interactive modules, assessment tools, digital Creed Cards, and weekly support content.

**Book a free 30-min strategy call** and I'll:
- Give you a live demo + instant dashboard access
- Help you create a custom implementation plan
- Mail you a free physical copy of the DNA Manual

[Button] Book Your Strategy Call

No pressure—just here to help you launch well.

## Email 2: Day 3 Check-In

**Subject:** Have you started reading yet?

**Preview Text:** Quick check-in on your DNA journey

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Just checking in. Have you had a chance to dive into the DNA Manual yet?

**If yes:** Awesome. What's standing out to you so far? Hit reply and let me know.

**If not yet:** No worries—life is busy. But I'd encourage you to carve out time this week. The manual is designed to be read over 6 sessions, but you could knock it out in a weekend if you're motivated.

**Quick question:** What's your biggest fear or hesitation about starting a DNA group?

Hit reply and let me know. I read every response.

And if you want to talk it through live, grab a time on my calendar:

[Link to booking]

You'll get:
- Live demo of the DNA Leaders Dashboard
- Custom implementation roadmap
- Free physical copy of the manual

Talk soon,

## Email 3: Day 7 Co-Leader Focus

**Subject:** Ready to find your co-leader?

**Preview Text:** This is the most important decision you'll make

**Body:**

[First Name],

One of the first steps in launching a DNA group is finding your co-leader.

Here's why this matters:
- Prevents burnout (shared workload)
- Provides accountability (you need it too)
- Models healthy partnership (shows disciples what teamwork looks like)
- Doubles your capacity (you can each focus on one disciple)

**Who comes to mind?**

Someone who:
- Is spiritually mature (not perfect, but growing)
- Is faithful and reliable (proven track record)
- Complements your gifting (different strengths than you)
- Is hungry to multiply (wants to make disciples)

**Feeling stuck on this?**

Let's talk it through. I can help you:
- Identify potential co-leaders in your circle
- Craft the invitation conversation
- Navigate any awkwardness or hesitation

Book a call: [Link]

Still get the free physical DNA Manual + dashboard access when you book.

## Email 4: Day 14 Direct Challenge

**Subject:** [First Name], what's holding you back?

**Preview Text:** Two weeks in—let's be honest

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Two weeks ago you downloaded the DNA system.

Since then, I'm guessing one of these is true:

**Option 1:** You've read it, you're fired up, and you're already moving forward.  
*(If so—awesome! Reply and tell me how it's going.)*

**Option 2:** You've started reading but haven't taken action yet.  
*(Normal. What's the next step you need to take?)*

**Option 3:** It's still sitting in your downloads folder.  
*(Also normal. Life is busy.)*

No judgment on any of these.

But here's the deal:

**Discipleship doesn't happen by accident.** You need a plan. And you need someone in your corner.

That's what the strategy call is for.

We'll create a custom roadmap for YOUR context so you actually launch (instead of just thinking about it).

30 minutes. Free. Plus you get:
- Dashboard access with all the tools
- Physical book shipped
- Ongoing support

What do you have to lose?

[Book Your Call]

## Email 5: Day 30 Final Push

**Subject:** Last call for your free DNA strategy session

**Preview Text:** I'm moving you to the general list after this

**Body:**

[First Name],

It's been a month since you downloaded the DNA resources.

I'm going to be direct: **Most people who download never implement.**

Not because the system doesn't work. But because they don't have a plan and they don't have support.

**This is your last reminder** to book a free strategy call.

After this, I'll move you to our general email list (still valuable content, but no more personal invitations for the call + dashboard access).

If you're serious about making disciples who make disciples, let's talk.

Book your call: [Link]

Still comes with:
- Free physical copy of the DNA Manual
- DNA Leaders Dashboard access
- Custom implementation plan

If you're not ready, no worries. You can always reach out later.

But don't let another month go by without taking action.

Travis

P.S. If you've already launched or you're working through the material on your own—reply and let me know how it's going. I'd love to hear.

## Email 6: Day 31+ (Moved to general nurture)

After day 30, they move to a general ARK Identity email list with:
- Weekly/bi-weekly discipleship tips
- New resources when available
- Event announcements
- Occasional "book a call" offers (but not pushy)

# Common Objections & How to Handle

## On Landing Page / Email:

**"I don't have time for this right now"**
Response in email: "I get it. The PDFs will be waiting whenever you're ready. Bookmark this email for when the season changes."

**"I've tried discipleship before and it didn't work"**
Response in email: "Most discipleship fails because there's no structure or multiplication plan. DNA is different—it's designed to reproduce from day one. Give it a read and see if it addresses what went wrong before."

## On Strategy Call:

**"I don't think I'm qualified to disciple anyone"**
Response: "That's actually a good sign—the people who think they're super qualified often struggle the most. DNA gives you a proven framework. You don't have to be an expert; you just have to be one step ahead and faithful."

**"What if I can't find a co-leader?"**
Response: "Start praying specifically about it. God will highlight someone. In rare cases, you might start solo and look for a co-leader in the first 3 months. But don't launch without at least actively seeking one—you'll burn out."

**"The people in my church aren't ready for this level of commitment"**
Response: "You might be surprised. People rise to the level of expectation you set. Start with the hungriest 1-2 people, not the whole church. DNA is quality over quantity."

**"How is this different from [other discipleship program]?"**
Response: "Most programs focus on individual growth. DNA focuses on producing disciple-makers who multiply. The 5-phase system has built-in checkpoints and a clear multiplication plan. It's not just about making better Christians—it's about making Christians who make disciples."

**"I'm not sure my church/denomination would support this"**
Response: "DNA is theologically sound and rooted in Scripture. It's not denominationally specific. That said, if your church leadership isn't open to multiplication discipleship, that's a bigger conversation you might need to have with them."
