## Email 4: Day 14 Direct Challenge

**Subject:** [First Name], still thinking about it?

**Preview Text:** Two weeks in—let's be honest

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Two weeks ago you downloaded the DNA Manual.

I'm guessing one of these is true:

1. **You've read it and you're interested** → Take the assessment and let's talk
2. **You're not sure it's right for your church** → That's okay. Reply and tell me what's holding you back.
3. **It's still sitting in your downloads folder** → No judgment. But it won't read itself.

If you're serious about multiplying disciple-makers, I'd love to help.

If not, no hard feelings. I'll stop emailing about this.

### Close (3 min)
**If fit:**
"The next step is a 60-minute strategy call where we'll map out your implementation plan. I'll also send you the Launch Guide after this call so you can start preparing. Want to book that now?"

**If not fit:**

# Common Objections & Responses

## During Assessment/Discovery

**"I'm not the decision-maker"**
→ "That's helpful to know. Is there a way to include [pastor/board] in our next conversation? DNA works best when leadership is aligned from the start."

**"We've tried discipleship programs before and they didn't stick"**
→ "Tell me more about what happened. [Listen] DNA is different because [address their specific issue]. But I want to make sure we're not repeating the same mistake."

**"Our pastor isn't fully on board yet"**
→ "That's actually a key indicator. DNA requires pastoral buy-in to succeed. Would it help if I had a brief call with your pastor to answer questions?"

## During Strategy Call

**"I don't think I'm qualified to lead this"**
→ "That's actually a good sign. The best DNA champions are humble learners. You don't have to be an expert—you just have to be willing to follow the process."

**"What if we can't find enough leaders?"**
→ "Start with who you have. Even 1-2 committed leaders is enough to pilot. Quality over quantity. Let's identify who those people might be right now."

**"This seems like a big commitment"**
→ "It is. DNA isn't for every church. But the churches that commit see real multiplication. The question is: is multiplying disciple-makers important enough to prioritize?"
