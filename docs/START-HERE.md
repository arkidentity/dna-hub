Hi! Continuing DNA ecosystem work.

Read: /docs/planning/NEXT-STEPS.md (full roadmap with weekly priorities)

What was just completed:
- Spiritual Gifts Assessment BUILT in Daily DNA app (core + PDF complete)
  - 96 questions, 3 tiers, scoring, results with synopses
  - 2-page PDF download (client-side via @react-pdf/renderer)
  - In-app route: /tools/spiritual-gifts (Week 11 checkpoint)
  - Public route: /gifts (requires account, no anonymous access)
  - Files: types/spiritualGifts.ts, lib/spiritualGiftsData.ts, lib/spiritualGiftsStorage.ts, lib/spiritualGiftsSynopses.ts, lib/spiritualGiftsPdf.tsx, components/gifts/SpiritualGiftsAssessment.tsx

What to work on next (pick based on time):
- Quick win: Week 8 → Week 12 fix across Hub (~15 min)
- Spiritual Gifts remaining: cloud sync to Supabase, /gifts auth gate, pastor landing page (lead gen)
- Bigger builds: Groups Calendar, Assessments Tab, Global Resources Admin

Key context:
- Daily DNA app is MVP-complete and live at dailydna.app
- DNA Hub is live at dna.arkidentity.com
- Both share same Supabase database
- Groups & Chat Phase 1 is live
- Training (Flow Assessment + Manual + Launch Guide) is complete
```

## What to Build Next 🔨

### **This Week: Spiritual Gifts Enhancements + Quick Wins**
1. ~~Core assessment UI~~ ✅ Built
2. ~~PDF generation for results~~ ✅ Built (2-page PDF via @react-pdf/renderer, client-side)
3. ~~Week 8 → Week 12 bug fix across Hub~~ ✅ Fixed (code only — DB migration still needed)
4. Cloud sync to Supabase (`spiritual_gifts_assessments` table)
5. `/gifts` public route → requires account creation (no anonymous test-taking)
6. Pastor landing page for lead gen (separate from `/gifts`, offers team assessment access)
7. Passage of the Day content expansion (265+ more passages)

### **Next Week:**
- Assessment to PDF for church milestones
- Disciple Profile — Assessments tab (Life Assessment scores + Spiritual Gifts results)
- Global Resources Admin UI (CRUD for church implementation resources)
- Groups Calendar (Supabase events, Resend reminders, .ics links)

### **Week 3:**
- Pathway locking (locked unless in DNA group)
- Cloud sync for Testimony Builder + Life Assessment
- Training ↔ Groups bridge

## Key Decisions (Feb 8, 2026)

- **Calendar:** Supabase source of truth. No Google Calendar API. Resend + .ics.
- **Pathway:** Locked unless in group. Unlock by phase/month. Creed Cards + Gifts + Testimony always available.
- **Notifications:** Email + in-app badges. No PWA push.
- **Training:** Should bridge to Groups dashboard. 90-Day Toolkit belongs in Groups.
- **Spiritual Gifts:** Same test, two contexts — in-app for disciples (Week 11), public at /gifts (requires account). No anonymous email capture. Lead gen is a separate pastor landing page on Hub that offers team assessment access.
- **Spiritual Gifts PDF:** 2-page compact PDF (overview + primary gift details). Client-side generation via @react-pdf/renderer. No server cost. ~100KB per file.
- **Fireflies:** Deprioritized.
