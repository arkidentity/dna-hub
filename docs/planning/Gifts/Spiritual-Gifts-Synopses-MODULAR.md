Your service might look like preparing meals, managing logistics, maintaining facilities, or coordinating volunteers. Whatever the task, you approach it with excellence and a servant's heart.

**Your service matters deeply.** You are the hands and feet of Jesus in the most practical ways. Don't underestimate the Kingdom impact of faithful, behind-the-scenes work.

This gift is rooted in Romans 12:8, where Paul describes generous givers as essential to the body of Christ. You're energized by seeing Kingdom work funded and people's needs met.

This gift is rooted in 1 Peter 4:9, which calls believers to "show hospitality to one another without grumbling." You're energized by hosting—whether it's a meal, a small group, a gathering, or simply a cup of coffee. You think about details that make people comfortable: the atmosphere, the food, the seating, the flow of conversation. You notice when someone's alone and invite them in.

## Implementation Notes

### Database Storage:
- Store **25 base synopses** in a `spiritual_gifts_base_synopses` table with columns: `gift_name`, `tier`, `synopsis_text`
- Store **bridge sentences** in a `spiritual_gifts_bridges` table with columns: `primary_gift`, `secondary_gift`, `bridge_text`
- Dynamically generate results by combining: Primary synopsis + Secondary summary + Bridge

### Results Page Logic:
```javascript
// Pseudocode
const primarySynopsis = getBaseSynopsis(primaryGift)
const secondarySummary = getBaseSynopsis(secondaryGift).substring(0, 200) + "..."
const bridge = getBridge(primaryGift, secondaryGift)

return {
  primary: {
    giftName: primaryGift,
    synopsis: primarySynopsis
  },
  secondary: {
    giftName: secondaryGift,
    summary: secondarySummary
  },
  together: bridge
}
```
