---

## Key Findings for DNA Hub Decision

### Gaps in Current Market:

1. **Identity Integration:** No tool comprehensively integrates spiritual gifts with identity in Christ
2. **Activation Exercises:** Most rank gifts but don't provide practical activation steps
3. **Safeguards:** Minimal teaching on healthy gift expression vs. identity attachment
4. **Comprehensive + Five-Fold:** Few tools assess BOTH serving gifts AND five-fold ministry callings
5. **Discipleship Context:** Most are standalone tools, not embedded in discipleship frameworks

### Best Existing Tools for Integration:

**For Embedding:**
- **ChurchGrowth.org** - Most established, 8M+ users, proven reliability
- **SpiritualGiftsTest.com** - API access, church dashboard
- **AssessME.org** - Strong integrations (CCB, PCO), personality filtering

**For Inspiration:**
- **AssessME** - Gift Expressions concept (personality integration)
- **Uniquely You** - Multiple assessment options, DISC integration
- **ServeWire VES** - Customization flexibility
- **Healthy Growing Leaders** - Formation-focused approach

### Recommendations:

#### Option 1: Use Existing + Enhance
- **Embed:** ChurchGrowth.org or SpiritualGiftsTest.com via API
- **Add DNA-specific layers:**
  - Identity in Christ teaching before/after assessment
  - Activation exercises tied to DNA discipleship phases
  - Safeguards against identity attachment to gifts
  - Integration with DNA leader dashboard

**Pros:** Fast implementation, proven tool, focus DNA effort on unique value
**Cons:** Limited customization, dependent on third-party, may not align perfectly with DNA theology

#### Option 2: Create Custom Multi-Part Assessment
- **Part 1:** Motivational Gifts (Romans 12) - Core identity/wiring
- **Part 2:** Serving Gifts (1 Cor 12 + practical) - How you serve
- **Part 3:** Five-Fold Calling (Ephesians 4) - Leadership/ministry direction
- **Part 4:** Identity Integration - How gifts flow from who you are in Christ

**Pros:** Perfect DNA alignment, unique differentiator, comprehensive framework, IP ownership
**Cons:** Development time, testing needed, no established credibility yet

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- **Phase 1:** Use existing tool (ChurchGrowth.org) with DNA wrapper for identity/safeguards
- **Phase 2:** Develop custom assessment based on learnings and user feedback
- **Phase 3:** Replace embedded tool with custom solution

**Pros:** Fast launch, learn from data, reduce risk, progressive investment
**Cons:** Migration complexity later, temporary dependency

## Technical Integration Considerations

### Available APIs:
- **SpiritualGiftsTest.com** - API for Church Admin subscribers (pricing unknown)
- **AssessME.org** - CCB and PCO integrations ($125 setup)
- Limited public API documentation found

### Embeddable Options:
- Most tools offer basic iframe embedding
- Few offer true white-label solutions
- ServeWire VES offers most customization but is paid platform

### Data Export:
- Most offer CSV export
- AssessME offers XML
- Group dashboards available for churches

### DNA Hub Integration Needs:
1. Link to disciple profiles in DNA Groups dashboard
2. Store results for DNA leader visibility
3. Track completion as milestone
4. Generate reports for church leaders
5. Potentially integrate with identity activation exercises

---

## Theological Considerations

### Sign Gifts Inclusion:
**DNA Hub Decision Needed:**
- Include tongues, healing, miracles, interpretation?
- Or focus on "serving gifts" like ChurchGrowth.org?
- Or make optional like AssessME?

### Five-Fold Ministry:
**DNA Hub Decision Needed:**
- Assess five-fold calling for DNA leaders?
- Or focus only on serving gifts for all disciples?
- Separate assessment for leaders vs. disciples?

### Gift vs. Role Clarity:
- Most tools conflate spiritual gifts with ministry roles
- DNA Hub could clarify: gifts are HOW you serve, roles are WHERE you serve

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Theological Review:**
   - DNA leadership decides on gift theology (sign gifts, five-fold, etc.)
   - Define DNA-specific framework for gifts in discipleship context

2. **Pilot Test:**
   - Test 2-3 existing tools with pilot DNA groups
   - Gather feedback on user experience and theological alignment
   - Identify gaps specific to DNA discipleship model

3. **Identity Framework Development:**
   - Create DNA-specific teaching on gifts flowing from identity in Christ
   - Develop safeguards against identity attachment to gifts
   - Design activation exercises for each gift category

4. **Decision Point (3-6 months):**
   - **If existing tools sufficient:** Integrate ChurchGrowth.org or SpiritualGiftsTest.com
   - **If gaps too large:** Develop custom multi-part DNA assessment
   - **If uncertain:** Proceed with hybrid approach

5. **Implementation:**
   - Integrate assessment into DNA Groups dashboard
   - Link to disciple profiles
