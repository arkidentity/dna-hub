## The Seven Practices of Level 5 Churches

### What is a Level 5 Church?

**Definition**: A church where disciple making is the core DNA and culture, where the average church member makes disciples to at least the fourth generation, and where disciple making activity regularly produces significant and diverse streams which multiply consistently into new churches.

**Reality Check**: In 2020, researchers found that less than 5% of churches in the USA were at Level 4 (reproducing disciples), and they could find NO Level 5 churches at that time. By 2025, they finally found Level 5 examples.

### The 7 Core Practices:

1. **Convictional Leadership** - Leaders who won't compromise on making disciples who make disciples as THE singular mission
2. **Obedience-Based, Reproducible Models** - Shockingly simple processes that anyone can learn and teach
3. **Prayer and Scripture as Foundations** - Not programs, but the engine of transformation
4. **Relational Community** - Life shared becomes life changed (tables, not classrooms)
5. **Clear Pathways and Expectations** - Everyone knows where they are and what comes next
6. **Celebration of Stories** - Regularly sharing stories of transformation
7. **Leadership Alignment** - Every leader bleeds the same mission

## The PB&J Framework: Prayer, Bible, Journal

### What It Is

**PB&J** is a simple daily rhythm used by Life Center Church (Spokane, WA) and other Level 5 churches:
- **P**rayer - Daily connection with God
- **B**ible - Scripture reading expecting to hear from God
- **J**ournal - Recording what you heard and your response

### Why It Works

**From the research:**
- 72% of participants reported their daily connection with Jesus increased
- ~1,200 people participate in groups built around this rhythm
- It requires only three things: a Bible, a pen, and a willing heart
- Teenagers can teach it. New believers can lead it. No training required.

**The genius**: "It's not the originality. It's the reproducibility."

### How They Use It

**Daily Practice:**
1. Open Scripture
2. Read expectantly (God will speak today)
3. Write what you sensed God saying
4. Pray and respond in obedience

**Weekly Small Groups:**
1. Members open their journals
2. Share: "What did you hear from God in Scripture this week?"
3. Discuss and encourage each other
4. Hold each other accountable to obedience

**Church-Wide Support:**
- Published quarterly "Follow Jesus Journal" with Bible reading plans
- Built-in reflection space and guiding questions
- Prompts for prayer and journaling

## Critical Insights for DNA Implementation

### 1. **Simplicity is the Secret to Multiplication**

**Quote**: "Complexity may impress, but simplicity spreads."

**Finding**: Level 5 churches stripped discipleship down to essentials:
- Scripture
- Obedience
- Reproduction

Their processes fit on a single page. A new believer can learn in weeks and teach immediately.

**DNA Application**:
- DNA already has simplicity advantage
- Need to emphasize the 3-word essence: Prayer, Bible, Journal (or DNA equivalent)
- Make it so simple a teenager or brand new believer can teach it

### 2. **Obedience Over Information**

**Quote**: "Jesus never told His followers to make converts or fill classrooms. He told them to teach people to obey everything He commanded."

**The Pattern Shift**:
- OLD WAY: Understand → Act
- LEVEL 5 WAY: Act → Understanding follows

**DNA Application**:
- Every DNA tool must prompt immediate, specific obedience
- Questions should be: "What will you obey?" not "What did you learn?"
- Track obedience, not completion

### 3. **The Eight-Week Discovery Process**

Multiple Level 5 churches use 8-week seeker processes that anyone can facilitate:
- Doug Burrier's method: Read, Highlight, Obey, Share
- Joey McLaughlin's "Equip": 10 weeks that launch a lifetime
- Simple enough that a woman in North Carolina learns it, moves to Sweden, and reproduces it there

**DNA Current State**: 8-week program already exists!

**Enhancement Opportunity**: Frame it explicitly as a reproducible model that participants can immediately turn around and lead for someone else.

### 4. **Measurement That Matters**

**What Level 5 Churches Track**:
- Who's practicing what they learned (not who finished)
- "What did you obey this week?"
- "Who are you sharing this with?"
- Fourth-generation disciples (disciples of disciples of disciples of disciples)

**What They DON'T Focus On**:
- Attendance
- Completion rates
- Program participation

**DNA Application**:
- Track daily PBJ practice (3D Journal + 4D Prayer usage)
- Track who disciples are now discipling
- Track generational depth (are disciples making disciples who make disciples?)

### 5. **Prayer as THE Foundation**

**Finding**: "Prayer wasn't preparation for the work. Prayer WAS the work."

**Brad Daugherty's Story** (New Beginnings Church):
- Church was growing numerically but Spirit had stopped coming
- Shifted to weekly prayer/fasting/repentance as heartbeat
- "Making disciples who make disciples was no longer a department; it became the DNA of the church"
- Result: Culture shift, transformation, multiplication

**DNA Application**:
- 4D Prayer isn't an "add-on" - it's the engine
- DNA leaders must model prayer-first posture
- Every group meeting begins with: "What did you hear from God this week?"

### 🎯 **Weekly Group Format Standardization**

**Based on Level 5 Pattern:**

**Every DNA Group Meeting Should Follow**:
1. **Open Journals** (3D Journal) - 5 min quiet reflection
2. **Share** - "What did you hear from God in Scripture this week?"
3. **Obedience Check** - "What did you obey from last week?"
4. **Learn Together** - Week's lesson/topic
5. **Commit to Obey** - "What specific thing will you do this week?"
6. **Pray** - Using 4D Prayer model

### 🎯 **Reproducibility Emphasis**

**Add to Week 8**:
- "You now know everything you need to disciple someone else"
- "The goal isn't to finish - it's to start again with someone new"
- Give simple 1-page handout: "How to Lead a DNA Group"

### 🎯 **Leader Tracking Dashboard**

**Add Metrics**:
- Daily 3D Journal entries (are disciples doing PBJ daily?)
- "Who are you currently discipling?" (multiplication tracking)
- Generational depth: 1st gen → 2nd gen → 3rd gen → 4th gen disciples

### 🎯 **Simplification Audit**

**Question for Every DNA Component**:
"Can a brand new believer who just completed 8 weeks turn around and lead someone else through this?"

If NO → Simplify until yes.

## Key Quotes for DNA Messaging

### On Simplicity:
> "The genius isn't in the sophistication of the model. It's in the accessibility. When obedience is simple, multiplication becomes inevitable."

### On Reproducibility:
> "A teenager can teach it. A new believer can practice it. A group of friends can adopt it in a coffee shop or a workplace break room. When the model is this simple, multiplication becomes natural."

### On Measurement:
> "Stop just tracking who 'finished' your program. Start tracking who's practicing what they learned. Completion is an event. Obedience is a lifestyle. Measure what matters."

### On the Mission:
> "Making disciples who make disciples was no longer a department; it became the DNA of the church."

### On Starting:
> "Multiplication happens through obedience, not information."

## Conclusion

The PB&J framework and Level 5 practices are NOT asking DNA to create something new - they're validating and providing language for what DNA is ALREADY DOING.

**The opportunity**:
- DNA already has the tools (3D Journal, 4D Prayer)
- DNA already has the 8-week model
- DNA already emphasizes simplicity

**The enhancement needed**:
- Make the PBJ connection explicit
- Shift from "complete a program" to "establish a lifestyle"
- Measure obedience and multiplication, not just participation
- Give disciples confidence: "You can do this. You can teach this."

**The vision**:
Churches using DNA should become Level 5 churches - where the average member makes disciples to the fourth generation, and multiplication becomes the culture, not just a program.

## Next Steps

1. **Review this analysis** with DNA leadership team
2. **Identify quick wins** (PBJ branding, measurement shifts)
3. **Pilot enhancements** with 2-3 churches
4. **Document multiplication stories** as they emerge
5. **Iterate based on results**

The research is clear: simplicity, obedience, and reproducibility create multiplication. DNA has all the pieces. Now it's about alignment, emphasis, and messaging.
