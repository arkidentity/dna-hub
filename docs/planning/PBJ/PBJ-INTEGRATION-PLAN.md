# PBJ INTEGRATION PLAN
**Making Prayer, Bible, Journal the Non-Negotiable Foundation**

---

## 🎯 THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**"If disciples won't commit to daily PBJ practice, how can we expect them to grow?"**

PBJ (Prayer, Bible, Journal) is:
- **P = 4D Prayer** (20 minutes)
- **B = Bible Reading** (engaging Scripture daily)
- **J = 3D Journal** (Discovery, Declaration, Devotion)

**Total daily time: 30-40 minutes**

This is the **non-negotiable foundation** for DNA discipleship. Without daily PBJ, DNA groups become Bible studies—not disciple-making environments.

---

## 📍 WHERE TO INTEGRATE PBJ LANGUAGE

### 1. DNA DISCIPLESHIP MANUAL - SESSION 4
**Current Section:** "Keep it Simple Saint" (already about simplicity)

**WHAT TO ADD:**
- **New Section Title:** "The Daily Rhythm: PBJ"
- **Placement:** Right after the "How often should you gather?" section
- **Length:** 1-2 pages
- **Content:**
  - Introduce PBJ framework explicitly
  - Explain: 4D Prayer + Bible + 3D Journal = PBJ
  - Make it clear: "This is the non-negotiable daily commitment for every disciple"
  - Research-backed: 72% deeper connection with Jesus (Level 5 churches)
  - Simple enough for anyone: teenagers, new believers, anyone can do this
  - This is what makes DNA different from Bible studies

**WHY SESSION 4:**
- Session 4 is about keeping discipleship simple
- It's BEFORE Phase 0 starts (sets expectation early)
- Leaders understand the daily commitment before inviting disciples

---

### 2. DNA LAUNCH GUIDE - PHASE 0
**Section:** "Setting Expectations Together"

**WHAT TO ADD:**
- **Add PBJ as the #1 expectation** (before time commitment, before duration)
- **New Language:**
  ```
  ### Daily Commitment: PBJ
  "DNA groups require a daily rhythm of Prayer, Bible, and Journal (PBJ):
  - **4D Prayer** - 20 minutes
  - **Bible Reading** - Engage Scripture daily
  - **3D Journal** - Discovery, Declaration, Devotion (10-15 minutes)

  **Total: 30-40 minutes daily**

  This isn't optional. Without daily PBJ practice, disciples won't grow.
  Before inviting someone, ask: 'Are you willing to commit to 30-40 minutes
  with God every day for 12 months?' If they can't commit to this, they're
  not ready for a DNA group."
  ```

**ALSO ADD TO:**
- **"The Direct Conversation"** section (when inviting disciples)
- **DNA Group Agreement template** (add checkbox: "I commit to daily PBJ practice")

**WHY PHASE 0:**
- Sets clear expectation BEFORE they join
- Filters out people who aren't ready for the commitment
- No surprises when Week 1 starts

---

### 3. 90-DAY TOOLKIT - MONTH 1
**Multiple Integration Points:**

#### **A. Toolkit Overview Document**
- **Add new section:** "The Foundation: Daily PBJ"
- Place it right after the introduction, before "Month 1 Overview"
- **Content:**
  ```
  ## The Foundation: Daily PBJ

  Everything in the 90-Day Toolkit builds on one simple daily rhythm:
  **Prayer, Bible, Journal (PBJ)**

  - Week 2: You'll learn 3D Journal (the "J")
  - Week 3: You'll learn 4D Prayer (the "P")
  - Every week: You're reading Scripture (the "B")

  **This is the non-negotiable foundation.** Without daily PBJ:
  - Weekly meetings become information transfer, not transformation
  - Disciples remain consumers, not contributors
  - Multiplication doesn't happen

  **Research shows:** Churches where members practice daily Prayer,
  Bible, and Journal see 72% report deeper connection with Jesus and
  natural multiplication to 4th generation disciples.

  **Your job as a leader:** Model daily PBJ yourself. Check on it weekly.
  Celebrate it consistently.
  ```

#### **B. Week 1 - Life Assessment**
- **Add to "Opening Prayer" section:**
  ```
  "God, over the next 12 weeks, we're committing to a daily rhythm of
  Prayer, Bible, and Journal. Meet us in that daily time. Transform us
  through consistency, not just information. In Jesus' name."
  ```

- **Add new section at the end (before "After the Meeting"):**
  ```
  ### The Daily PBJ Commitment (5 min)

  **Leader explains:**
  "Before we leave tonight, I want to be clear about the #1 expectation
  for the next 12 weeks: **Daily PBJ—Prayer, Bible, Journal.**

  - Over the next 3 weeks, we'll teach you HOW to do each of these
  - But starting tomorrow, I want you practicing SOME form of it daily
  - Even if it's imperfect, build the rhythm now

  This isn't homework. This is the heartbeat of discipleship. If you're
  not willing to spend 30-40 minutes with God daily, we need to talk
  privately about whether this is the right season for you."

  **Challenge for Week 1:**
  - Spend 10 minutes daily reading Scripture
  - Journal: What did you read? What stood out? What will you obey?
  - Pray for 10 minutes (we'll teach structure in Week 3)
  ```

#### **C. Week 2 - 3D Journal**
- **Add at the beginning:**
  ```
  "This week, you're learning the 'J' in PBJ—the 3D Journal."
  ```
- **Emphasize:** "This is your daily practice, not a weekly assignment."

#### **D. Week 3 - 4D Prayer**
- **Add at the beginning:**
  ```
  "This week, you're learning the 'P' in PBJ—4D Prayer."
  ```
- **Connect it:** "You've been practicing 3D Journal (J) and Bible reading (B).
  Now we're adding structured prayer (P). This completes your daily PBJ rhythm."

#### **E. Week 4 - Creed Cards**
- **Add check-in section:**
  ```
  ### Daily PBJ Check-In (5 min)
  "Let's do a quick check: How many days this week did you do PBJ?
  - 7 days? Awesome—celebrate!
  - 4-6 days? Great start—what's blocking the other days?
  - 0-3 days? Let's problem-solve together. What's in the way?"
  ```

#### **F. Every Week After Week 4**
- **Add to "Check-In" sections:** Quick PBJ accountability question
- **Standard prompt:** "How's daily PBJ going? Any wins or struggles?"

---

### 4. SIMPLIFIED LEADER GUIDES
**Add to ALL 12 weekly guides:**

**In "Before the Meeting" section:**
- ☐ Check: Are disciples doing daily PBJ? Follow up with anyone struggling.

**In "Meeting Flow" - Check-In section:**
- "How's daily PBJ going this week? (3D Journal, 4D Prayer, Bible reading)"

**In "After the Meeting" section:**
- ☐ Text anyone who's not doing daily PBJ—identify barriers

---

### 5. CREATE NEW RESOURCE: "PBJ ONE-PAGE EXPLAINER"
**Location:** `/resources/PBJ-FOR-DISCIPLES.md`

**Purpose:** Hand this to every disciple in Week 1

**Contents:**
- What is PBJ?
- Why does it matter?
- How to do it (simple daily steps)
- "Can I really do this?" (Yes—teenagers do this)
- Troubleshooting common barriers
- The non-negotiable commitment

(I'll create this document next)

## 🔑 KEY MESSAGING POINTS

### For Leaders (DNA Discipleship Manual)
> "PBJ is the engine of transformation. Without it, DNA groups become Bible studies. With it, disciples become disciple-makers."

### For Future Disciples (DNA Launch Guide - The Invitation)
> "DNA requires a daily commitment: 30-40 minutes of Prayer, Bible, and Journal. If you can't commit to that, this isn't the right season for you."

### For Current Disciples (90-Day Toolkit)
> "Everything we do in our weekly meetings builds on your daily PBJ practice. This is non-negotiable."

- Leaders are checking on daily PBJ practice weekly

**Within 3 months:**
- 80%+ of disciples doing PBJ 5+ days/week
- Disciples can articulate: "PBJ is what makes DNA work"
- Stories emerging of transformation through daily rhythm

---

## 🚨 WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ **Don't make PBJ feel like legalism**
- It's a rhythm, not a checklist
- Grace for imperfection, but expectation of commitment

❌ **Don't introduce PBJ as "optional" or "bonus"**
- It's the foundation, not an add-on
- Without it, DNA won't produce multiplication

❌ **Don't assume disciples will figure it out on their own**
- Teach it explicitly in Weeks 2-3
- Check on it weekly
- Problem-solve barriers together

❌ **Don't let this become a new "program"**
- PBJ is already in DNA (4D + Bible + 3D)
- This is just making explicit what was implicit

---

## 🎯 THE BOTTOM LINE

**Before PBJ Integration:**
"DNA is an 8-week discipleship program with tools for spiritual growth."

**After PBJ Integration:**
"DNA establishes a daily Prayer, Bible, Journal rhythm that creates disciples who make disciples. We use the same simple practices as Level 5 multiplying churches—because it works."

---

**Next Step:** Implement changes to all documents listed above.
