# DNA + PB&J Implementation Checklist
## Turning DNA into a Level 5 Multiplication System

---

## Phase 1: Internal Alignment (Week 1-2)

### Leadership Team
- [ ] Review the Level 5 Churches analysis document
- [ ] Watch/read examples of PBJ in action (Life Center Church)
- [ ] Discuss: "What would multiplication look like in our context?"
- [ ] Commit to measuring obedience over attendance

### Language & Branding
- [ ] Officially adopt "PB&J" language for DNA groups
- [ ] Create simple talking points connecting:
  - 4D Prayer = P
  - Bible reading = B
  - 3D Journal = J
- [ ] Update website/materials to reference "Prayer, Bible, Journal daily rhythm"

### Measurement Shift
- [ ] Identify current metrics (attendance, completion, etc.)
- [ ] Define new metrics:
  - Daily PBJ practice rate
  - Number of disciples each person is discipling
  - Generational depth (track to 4th generation)
- [ ] Set up tracking system in DNA Hub dashboard

---

## Phase 2: Content Updates (Week 3-6)

### Week 1 Enhancement
- [ ] Add "Daily PBJ Habit" as primary Week 1 goal
- [ ] Create simple daily prompts:
  - What Scripture did you read?
  - What stood out to you?
  - What will you obey today?
- [ ] Design Week 1 around establishing rhythm, not just information

### Weekly Group Format Standardization
- [ ] Create standard meeting flow (see below)
- [ ] Update all 8 weeks to follow this pattern
- [ ] Train DNA leaders on the format

**Standard Meeting Flow**:
```
1. GATHER & OPEN JOURNALS (5 min)
   - Arrive, settle in, open 3D Journals
   - Quiet reflection: review this week's PBJ entries

2. SHARE (15 min)
   - "What did you hear from God in Scripture this week?"
   - "What stood out in your prayer time?"
   - Go around the circle, everyone shares

3. OBEDIENCE CHECK (10 min)
   - "Last week you committed to _____. How did it go?"
   - Celebrate obedience stories
   - Problem-solve obstacles together

4. THIS WEEK'S FOCUS (30 min)
   - Lesson/discussion for this week
   - Keep it interactive, not lecture
   - Connect to real obedience

5. COMMIT TO OBEY (10 min)
   - "What specific thing will you DO this week?"
   - Write it in journals
   - Share commitments out loud

6. PRAY TOGETHER (10 min)
   - Use 4D Prayer model
   - Pray for each other's commitments
   - Pray for those you're reaching
```

### Week 8 Multiplication Focus
- [ ] Reframe Week 8 as "commissioning" not "graduation"
- [ ] Add: "You now know everything needed to lead someone through DNA"
- [ ] Create 1-page "How to Lead a DNA Group" handout
- [ ] Include in Week 8: "Who will you invite to start DNA with?"
- [ ] Set expectation: finishing = starting with someone new

### Simplification Audit
- [ ] Review every week's content
- [ ] Apply test: "Can a new believer teach this after going through once?"
- [ ] Remove anything requiring special training
- [ ] Rewrite overly complex sections
- [ ] Make everything fit the "Read → Highlight → Obey → Share" pattern

---

## Phase 3: Leader Training (Week 7-8)

### Train All DNA Leaders On:

**1. The PBJ Framework**
- [ ] What it is: Prayer, Bible, Journal daily
- [ ] Why it works: simplicity → multiplication
- [ ] How DNA already has all three tools
- [ ] Their job: model it daily, check on it weekly

**2. Obedience-Based Facilitation**
- [ ] Shift from teaching information → facilitating obedience
- [ ] Every meeting asks: "What will you obey?"
- [ ] Next meeting asks: "Did you obey? What happened?"
- [ ] Celebrate doing > knowing

**3. Multiplication Mindset**
- [ ] Goal isn't program completion
- [ ] Goal is disciples making disciples making disciples
- [ ] Week 1: "By Week 8, you'll be ready to lead someone"
- [ ] Week 8: "Who's next? Let's get you started."
- [ ] Track: Who is each disciple now discipling?

**4. The Simplicity Principle**
- [ ] If it's too complex to reproduce, simplify it
- [ ] Leaders should be able to explain DNA in 30 seconds
- [ ] Practice the 30-second explanation together
- [ ] Make reproducibility the priority over sophistication

---

## Phase 4: Pilot & Iterate (Week 9-20)

### Select Pilot Groups
- [ ] Choose 2-3 DNA groups to pilot new approach
- [ ] Mix of new and existing groups
- [ ] Get leader buy-in on trying new format

### Weekly Check-ins with Pilot Leaders
- [ ] Week-by-week feedback sessions
- [ ] What's working? What's confusing?
- [ ] Are disciples doing daily PBJ?
- [ ] Are obedience commitments happening?
- [ ] Document stories and testimonies

### Gather Data
- [ ] Track daily PBJ practice rate
- [ ] Track obedience commitments made/kept
- [ ] Survey participants at Weeks 4 and 8
- [ ] Ask: "Has your daily connection with Jesus increased?"
- [ ] Compare to Life Center's 72% benchmark

### Iteration Cycle
- [ ] Identify what needs adjustment
- [ ] Make changes to materials/training
- [ ] Test with next pilot group
- [ ] Repeat until it works smoothly

---

## Phase 5: Full Rollout (Month 6+)

### Updated Materials
- [ ] All content reflects PBJ language
- [ ] Week 1 focuses on establishing daily habit
- [ ] Standard meeting format in all materials
- [ ] Week 8 multiplication commissioning
- [ ] 1-page "How to Lead DNA" guide included

### Leader Onboarding
- [ ] New DNA leaders trained in:
  - PBJ framework
  - Obedience-based facilitation
  - Multiplication mindset
  - Simplicity principle
- [ ] Require leaders to have completed DNA themselves
- [ ] Require leaders to be doing daily PBJ personally

### Church Partnership Messaging
- [ ] Update DNA pitch to churches:
  - "Based on Level 5 church research"
  - "Prayer, Bible, Journal daily rhythm"
  - "Simple enough for anyone to lead"
  - "Creates disciples who make disciples who make disciples"
- [ ] Share pilot results and stories
- [ ] Offer training for church leaders

### Dashboard Updates
- [ ] Add PBJ practice tracking to DNA Hub
- [ ] Add "Who are you discipling?" to leader check-ins

- [ ] Create reports showing multiplication metrics
- [ ] Celebrate 4th generation disciples publicly

## Key Questions to Keep Asking

### Weekly:
- Are disciples doing daily PBJ?
- Are we measuring obedience or just attendance?
- What stories of transformation happened this week?

### Monthly:
- Is our process simple enough to reproduce?
- Who are our disciples now discipling?
- What barriers to multiplication exist?

### Quarterly:
- Are we seeing 2nd generation disciples?
- What do churches say about culture change?
- How can we simplify even further?

---

## The Non-Negotiables

As you implement, these must remain central:

1. **Daily PBJ Practice**
   - Not optional, not "nice to have"
   - Model it, check on it, celebrate it
   - This is the engine of transformation

2. **Obedience Over Information**
   - Always ask: "What will you obey?"
   - Always follow up: "Did you obey?"
   - Celebrate doing, not just knowing

3. **Reproducibility Priority**
   - If it's too complex, simplify
   - New believers must be able to lead it
   - Accessibility > sophistication

4. **Multiplication Expectation**
   - Week 1: "You'll learn to lead this"
   - Week 8: "Now go lead someone"
   - Track who disciples are discipling

5. **Measure What Matters**
   - Not attendance or completion
   - Daily practice, obedience, multiplication
   - Track to 4th generation

- "Creates disciples who make disciples who make disciples"
- "Results: [share pilot data and stories]"

### To Disciples:
- "You're learning the same rhythm that multiplying churches use"
- "Prayer, Bible, Journal every day"

## Quick Reference: The 3 Big Shifts

| FROM | TO |
|------|-----|
| Complete a program | Establish a lifestyle |
| Learn information | Practice obedience |
| Attend for 8 weeks | Lead someone within 12 weeks |
| Track attendance | Track multiplication |
| Complex curriculum | Simple reproducible model |
| Teacher-dependent | Peer-reproducible |

## Next Actions (Do Today)

1. [ ] Print this checklist
2. [ ] Schedule Phase 1 leadership meeting
3. [ ] Identify 2-3 pilot groups for Phase 4
4. [ ] Start using "PBJ" language internally
5. [ ] Begin drafting 1-page "How to Lead DNA" guide

**Remember**: You're not creating something new. You're aligning what DNA already has (3D Journal, 4D Prayer, 8 weeks) with proven Level 5 practices. The tools exist. This is about emphasis, clarity, and multiplication mindset.
