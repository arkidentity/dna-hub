# PB&J Integration Quick Guide
## Connecting DNA Tools to Level 5 Church Practices

---

## The Big Idea

**PB&J = Prayer, Bible, Journal**

Life Center Church in Spokane uses these three words as their entire discipleship system:
- 72% of participants report deeper connection with Jesus
- 1,200+ people in groups
- Multiplication happening naturally
- Requires zero special training

**DNA already has this**: 4D Prayer + Bible + 3D Journal = PB&J

---

## Why PB&J Works (Research-Backed)

1. **Simple enough for anyone** - Teenagers lead it. New believers can do it.
2. **Reproducible** - Woman learns it in North Carolina, moves to Sweden, teaches it there
3. **Focuses on obedience** - Not "what did you learn?" but "what will you obey?"
4. **Creates multiplication** - When the model is this simple, people naturally pass it on

**Quote**: "Complexity may impress, but simplicity spreads."

## The 7 Practices of Level 5 Churches

(Level 5 = churches where average members make disciples to 4th generation)

1. **Convictional Leadership** - Making disciples is THE mission, not one of many
2. **Obedience-Based Models** - Do it, don't just learn it
3. **Prayer & Scripture** - The engine, not add-ons
4. **Relational Community** - Tables, not classrooms
5. **Clear Pathways** - Everyone knows: where am I, what's next, what's expected
6. **Celebration of Stories** - Regularly share transformation stories
7. **Leadership Alignment** - Every leader bleeds same mission

## 5 Quick Wins for DNA

### 1. Rebrand with PBJ Language
"DNA groups use the same PB&J rhythm that Level 5 disciple-making churches use"
- 4D Prayer = P
- Bible engagement = B
- 3D Journal = J

**Impact**: Connects DNA to proven research, makes it memorable

### 2. Week 1: Establish Daily PBJ Habit
First 7 days focus on:
- Do PB&J every day
- Simple prompts: What did you read? What stood out? What will you obey?
- Build the rhythm before diving into content

**Impact**: Creates sustainable daily practice from day 1

### 3. Standardize Weekly Group Format
Every meeting:
1. Open journals (quiet reflection)
2. Share: "What did you hear from God this week?"
3. Obedience check: "What did you do from last week?"
4. This week's lesson
5. Commitment: "What will you obey this week?"
6. Pray together

**Impact**: Makes meetings about obedience, not just information

### 4. Week 8: "You Can Lead This"
Add explicit commissioning:
- "You now know everything needed to disciple someone"
- Give them 1-page "How to Lead a DNA Group" guide
- The goal isn't to finish - it's to multiply

**Impact**: Shifts from program completion to movement multiplication

### 5. Track What Matters
Stop measuring: attendance, completion rates
Start measuring:
- Daily PBJ practice (journal entries)
- "Who are you currently discipling?"
- Generational depth (1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th gen disciples)

**Impact**: Measures actual multiplication, not just participation

---

## The "Obedience Over Information" Shift

**Level 5 Pattern**:
- OLD: Understand first → then act
- NEW: Act first → understanding follows

**For DNA Groups**:
- Every lesson ends with: "What specific thing will you DO this week?"
- Next meeting starts with: "Did you do it? What happened?"
- Celebrate obedience stories, not theological knowledge

---

## Marketing Language

### Current State:
"DNA is an 8-week discipleship program"

### Level 5 Language:
"DNA uses the same simple practices as Level 5 multiplying churches:
- Prayer, Bible, Journal every day
- Obedience-based learning
- Simple enough that anyone can lead it
- Proven to create disciples who make disciples who make disciples"

---

## The Simplicity Test

**For every component of DNA, ask**:
> "Can a brand new believer who just finished 8 weeks turn around and lead someone else through this?"

If NO → Simplify until YES

**Why**: Level 5 churches multiply because their models require:
- No seminary training
- No extensive resources
- No specialized gifts
- Just: a Bible, a pen, a willing heart

---

## Key Stats from Research

- **95% of churches** are plateaued or declining (Levels 1-3)
- **Less than 5%** reproduce disciples (Level 4)
- **Almost none** multiply to 4th generation disciples (Level 5)
- **72%** at Life Center report deeper Jesus connection through PBJ
- **1,200+** people in PBJ-based groups at one church

**The gap**: Most churches do addition (bring people in). Level 5 churches do multiplication (send people out).

## Three-Word Framework Examples

**Life Center Church**: Prayer, Bible, Journal
**Doug Burrier**: Read, Highlight, Obey, Share
**DNA Could Be**: Prayer, Bible, Journal OR Disciple, Nurture, Activate

**Why this matters**:
- Instantly memorable
- Reduces complexity
- Anyone can explain it
- Emphasizes reproducibility

---

## Implementation Priority

### IMMEDIATE (This Week):
- Start using PBJ language internally
- Connect 3D Journal + 4D Prayer + Bible = PBJ

### SHORT-TERM (This Month):
- Add PBJ daily habit to Week 1
- Standardize weekly group format
- Create 1-page "How to Lead DNA" guide

### MEDIUM-TERM (Next Quarter):
- Update all materials with PBJ emphasis
- Add multiplication tracking metrics
- Pilot with 2-3 churches, gather stories

---

## The Bottom Line

**DNA doesn't need to reinvent anything.**

The tools exist:
✅ 3D Journal
✅ 4D Prayer
✅ 8-week model
✅ Emphasis on obedience

**What's needed**:
1. Make the PBJ connection explicit
2. Emphasize daily rhythm, not just weekly meetings
3. Measure multiplication, not completion
4. Commission every graduate: "Now you lead one"

**The vision**:
Every DNA church becomes a Level 5 church - where average members make disciples to the 4th generation, and multiplication becomes culture, not just a program.

---

## One Sentence Summary

**PB&J (Prayer, Bible, Journal) is the simple, reproducible framework that Level 5 churches use to multiply disciples - and DNA already has all three pieces, it just needs to connect them explicitly and measure the right things.**
