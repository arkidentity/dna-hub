# Level 5 Churches: Powerful Quotes & Messaging
## Use These for DNA Marketing, Training, and Church Partnerships

---

## On Simplicity & Reproducibility

> "Complexity may impress, but simplicity spreads."

> "The genius isn't in the sophistication of the model. It's in the accessibility. When obedience is simple, multiplication becomes inevitable."

> "If a model requires seminary training, extensive resources, or specialized gifts to reproduce, it will never multiply."

> "A teenager can teach it. A new believer can practice it. A group of friends can adopt it in a coffee shop or a workplace break room. When the model is this simple, multiplication becomes natural."

> "The beauty of PBJ isn't its originality. It's its reproducibility."

> "No staff needed. No building required. Just obedience."

**DNA Application**: Emphasize that DNA is designed to be so simple that anyone can lead it after going through it once.

---

## On Obedience Over Information

> "Jesus never told His followers to make converts or fill classrooms. He told them to teach people to obey everything He commanded."

> "That single word—obey—marks the difference between disciples who consume information and disciples who change the world."

> "Transformation doesn't require complexity. It requires clarity and follow-through."

> "When people practice what they learn—immediately, simply, and together—the Word becomes flesh again in every neighborhood, workplace, and friendship."

> "Stop just tracking who 'finished' your program. Start tracking who's practicing what they learned."

> "Completion is an event. Obedience is a lifestyle. Measure what matters."

**DNA Application**: Every lesson must end with "What will you obey this week?" and every meeting must start with "Did you obey? What happened?"

---

## On Multiplication vs. Addition

> "Addition was never going to get the job done."

> "Most churches grow by addition, not multiplication. They can claim increased attendance but struggle to point to disciples who are making disciples."

> "It's addition. It may fill church buildings. But it's not life-on-life engagement. It's not multiplication."

> "The gap between activity and reproduction, between busyness and transformation, has become the quiet crisis of the modern church."

> "We've professionalized the role of making disciples. We've made it so complex that ordinary believers think, 'I could never do that.' And multiplication stopped."

**DNA Application**: DNA exists to create multiplication, not addition. The goal isn't more people attending - it's more people discipling.

---

## On the PBJ Framework

> "Three words: Prayer, Bible, Journal. That's the entire discipleship system."

> "It requires only three things: a Bible, a pen, and a willing heart."

> "72% of participants report their daily connection with Jesus increased because of PBJ."

> "Weekly group questions such as 'What did you hear from God in Scripture this week?' have turned personal devotion into shared expectation."

> "PBJ rhythm requires nothing more than a Bible, a pen, and a willing heart, yet it trains hundreds to hear and follow God daily."

**DNA Application**: DNA provides the PBJ tools - 4D Prayer, Bible engagement, 3D Journal. It's the proven daily rhythm of Level 5 churches.

---

## On Prayer & Scripture as Foundation

> "Prayer wasn't preparation for the work. Prayer WAS the work."

> "Without God, disciple making is just religious activity. With God, it becomes a Holy Spirit-powered movement."

> "Level 5 churches don't just study the Bible—they expect it to speak. They don't read it for information but for encounter."

> "The Word wasn't a resource to reference—it was life itself."

> "Making disciples who make disciples was no longer a department; it became the DNA of the church."

**DNA Application**: 4D Prayer and daily Bible reading aren't add-ons to DNA - they ARE DNA. They're the engine that powers everything else.

---

## On Relational Community

> "Life shared becomes life changed."

> "Discipleship doesn't happen as effectively in classrooms, as it happens at tables."

> "You can't disciple someone you don't know. And you can't know someone you only see on Sundays."

> "Relational community isn't an add-on to spiritual life—it's the environment where disciple making happens."

> "The early church devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer (Acts 2:42). These weren't four separate programs. They were one integrated life."

**DNA Application**: DNA groups are families, not classrooms. They eat together, share real life, and do life-on-life discipleship.

---

## On Clear Pathways & Expectations

> "Confusion is the enemy of obedience."

> "Everyone knows where they are in the journey. Everyone knows what comes next. And everyone knows the expectation: you will be discipled, and you will disciple others."

> "They turn desire into direction."

**DNA Application**: DNA provides crystal clear pathway - 8 weeks, specific expectations, and clear next step: go disciple someone.

---

## On Leadership Alignment

> "Every leader—from the senior pastor to the newest volunteer—bleeds the same mission."

> "If a potential leader can't answer, 'Who are you personally discipling right now?' they don't get the job or the leadership role."

> "Every decision filters through one question: Does this advance the mission of making disciples who make disciples?"

> "Being disciples and making disciples who make disciples is why we exist."

**DNA Application**: Every DNA leader must be actively discipling someone. If they're not making disciples, they can't lead DNA.

---

## On Conviction & Mission

> "Convictional leadership is where every Level 5 story begins."

> "Making disciples who make disciples is the singular mission Jesus gave His church. Not one priority among many."

> "They're not chasing success; they're consumed by calling."

> "You can't manufacture a move of God, but you can be prepared for one."

> "If we love God, we will love whom he loves. God loves lost people and he loves saved people."

**DNA Application**: Churches using DNA must embrace making disciples as THE mission, not one of many ministries.

## Statistics to Reference

- **95% of churches** in the USA are plateaued or in decline (Levels 1-3)
- **Less than 5%** of churches reproduce disciples (Level 4)
- **Almost no churches** (when first studied in 2020) were multiplying to 4th generation (Level 5)
- **72%** of Life Center Church participants report deeper Jesus connection through PBJ
- **1,200+** people participate in PBJ-based groups at Life Center Church
- **23%** of churches in 2020 study had ANY way to measure if disciples were being formed

**DNA Application**: DNA puts churches in the top 5% by providing a reproducible system that creates multiplication.

---

## The Level 5 Definition

> "A Disciple Making Church (Level 5) – A church where disciple making is the core DNA and culture of the church, where the average church member makes disciples to at least the fourth generation, and where disciple making activity is regularly produced in significant and diverse streams within the church which multiply consistently into new churches."

**DNA Application**: Churches using DNA can become Level 5 churches - where the average member makes disciples to the 4th generation.

---

## The Disciple Definition

> "A disciple is someone who is following Jesus, being changed by Jesus, and is committed to the mission of Jesus."

**DNA Application**: DNA produces disciples who follow (obedience), are changed (transformation), and join the mission (multiplication).

## Messaging Frameworks

### 1. The Problem-Solution Framework

**PROBLEM**:
- 95% of churches plateaued/declining
- Most churches measure attendance, not multiplication
- Complex programs require experts to lead
- Disciples consume information but don't make disciples

**SOLUTION** (DNA):
- Based on Level 5 church research (top 5%)
- Measures obedience and multiplication
- Simple enough for anyone to lead after 8 weeks
- Creates disciples who make disciples who make disciples

### 2. The "Three Words" Framework

**LEVEL 5 CHURCHES**: Prayer, Bible, Journal
**DNA PROVIDES**: 4D Prayer, Bible engagement, 3D Journal
**RESULT**: 72% report deeper Jesus connection (Life Center), multiplication to 4th generation

### 3. The Transformation Pathway

**WEEK 1**: Establish daily PBJ habit
**WEEKS 2-7**: Practice obedience in community
**WEEK 8**: Commission to lead someone else
**WEEKS 9-16**: Lead your first DNA group
**RESULT**: Multiplication becomes natural, not forced

### 4. The Simplicity Framework

> "Can a brand new believer who just finished 8 weeks turn around and lead someone else through this?"

**IF NO**: Too complex, won't multiply
**IF YES**: Simple enough to create movement

**DNA ANSWER**: YES - by design

### 5. The Measurement Framework

**DON'T MEASURE**:
- Attendance
- Completion rates
- Program participation

**DO MEASURE**:
- Daily PBJ practice
- Obedience commitments
- Who is discipling whom
- Generational depth (to 4th generation)

## Talking Points for Different Audiences

### For Church Leaders

"DNA uses the same practices as Level 5 multiplying churches - the top 5% who create disciples to the 4th generation. It's based on extensive research of what actually works, not theory. The framework is simple: Prayer, Bible, Journal daily, combined with weekly obedience-based community. After 8 weeks, participants are equipped to lead someone else through it. You don't need trained professionals - you need obedient disciples who are willing to multiply."

### For DNA Leaders

"Your job isn't to be an expert teacher. Your job is to model daily PBJ (Prayer, Bible, Journal), facilitate obedience-based discussions, and commission graduates to multiply. Every week asks: 'What did you hear from God? What will you obey? Who are you reaching?' You're not building attendees - you're building disciple-makers. By Week 8, they should be ready to lead someone else."

### For Potential Disciples

"DNA isn't another Bible study you attend. It's a simple daily rhythm that Level 5 churches use: Prayer, Bible, Journal every day. You'll meet weekly with a small group to share what you're hearing from God, commit to specific obedience, and practice life-on-life discipleship. In 8 weeks, you'll know everything you need to disciple someone else. The goal isn't to finish a program - it's to start a lifestyle of making disciples who make disciples."

### For Donors/Supporters

"Only 5% of churches in America are reproducing disciples. Almost none are multiplying to the 4th generation. DNA provides a proven, simple system based on Level 5 church research - the churches that ARE seeing multiplication. We're not creating attendees; we're creating movements. When you support DNA, you're investing in a model that creates exponential impact through multiplication, not just linear growth through addition."

## Closing Thought

The most powerful message from the Level 5 research is this:

> "Multiplication doesn't happen through better programs, bigger budgets, or more professional staff. It happens through simple, reproducible, obedience-based practices that ordinary believers can do and teach."

**That's exactly what DNA is designed to be.**

Use these quotes, stats, and frameworks to communicate that DNA isn't just another discipleship program - it's a Level 5 system proven to create multiplication.
