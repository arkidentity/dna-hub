# Future Features & Notes

## Onboarding Questionnaire (Post-Commitment)

After a church commits via strategy call, we need a separate onboarding questionnaire to gather implementation details. This should be sent after they're activated in the system.

**Questions to include (moved from pre-commitment assessment):**

### Training & Logistics
- How would you prefer to train/equip your DNA leaders? (in-person, video, self-paced, hybrid)
- How often are your potential DNA leaders available for training?
- What's your annual budget for leadership development/training?

### Implementation Details
- How many DNA groups do you hope to launch initially?
- What existing small group or discipleship structures do you currently have?

### Support Needs
- What support do you need most from ARK Identity?
  - Leader training
  - Help communicating DNA vision
  - Ongoing coaching
  - Troubleshooting
  - Resources (printed materials, digital tools)
  - Strategy session for customizing DNA

### Success Metrics
- What does success look like for DNA at your church in 12 months?
- What's the #1 thing you hope DNA will accomplish?
- How will you measure whether DNA is working?

### Potential Barriers
- What obstacles might prevent DNA from succeeding at your church?
